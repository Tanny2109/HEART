2. Hair color","1. Insult
2. Ugliness
3. Appearance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.

**Keywords:** abusive language, condescending tone, silencing attempt

**Background:** Recently, a well-known environmental scientist named Dr. Sylvia Carter (sylviacarter) published her groundbreaking research on climate change on the online academic network ""EcoNet"". In one of her posts, she strongly advocated for stricter government policies to combat pollution and promote sustainability.

After her post went viral, she started receiving direct messages on EcoNet from an anonymous user named ""PollutionIsntReality"" (polluters_reality). The conversations escalated rapidly with the sender using abusive language and a condescending tone to silence Dr. Carter's voice in the public discourse.

**Platform:** EcoNet

**Victim:** Dr. Sylvia Carter (sylviacarter)

**Harasser:**

Victim: Yes? What about them?
Harasser: Quite frankly, I think you're speaking out of turn and don't know what you're talking about.
Victim: That's not true, my research is based on extensive data and evidence.
Harasser: Sure, but how many people are actually listening to you? You might be popular among some, but ultimately, your ideas will fall flat.
Victim: I disagree. My work has been well-received by the scientific community and I have received numerous offers to collaborate.
Harasser: Oh sure, that's because you're playing the popularity game. Real scientists focus on their work, not on seeking praise.
Victim: It's not about seeking praise, but sharing invaluable information to save our planet for future generations.
Harasser: Save your breath, Dr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. No one really cares about your so-called ""environmental advocacy"".
Victim: That's a very condescending and hurtful thing to say. My work has real-world implications and can lead to positive change.
Harasser: Change? Sure, from ""save the environment"" buzzwords to actual results, there's quite the gap.
Victim: What are you trying to insinuate? That I'm not making an effort?
Harasser: No need for insults, Dr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I'm merely pointing out that your opinions may not have much weight in the grand scheme of things.
Victim: My research has already led to multiple initiatives and policy changes; this alone proves its value.
Harasser: Yeah, keep sugarcoating it, but the truth is out there. And trust me, you won't find many supporters on EcoNet for your crusade.
Victim: Why must you be so negative? I'm trying to inspire positive change, just like countless other scientists before me.
Harasser: Save your energy, Dr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. No matter how much you strive to convince ""everybody"" that the planet needs saving, there will always be someone who questions and laughs at your efforts.
Victim: I refuse to let this discourage me from my mission to create a positive change for our world.
Harasser: Go ahead then. Make EcoNet your pulpit to shout about the sky being blue if you wish. I'll still call out every piece of flawed reasoning that passes for ""groundbreaking research"".
Victim: Thank you for your feedback, but don't feel obligated to keep this conversation going if all you want to do is belittle my contributions.
Harasser: That's the reality, Dr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. You should brace yourself for the scrutiny that comes from promoting such lofty ideals without concrete evidence.
Victim: I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this topic. I wish you could see the positive impact my work has had so far.
Harasser: Spare me the details, Dr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I'm immune to your emotional appeals. Good luck with your endeavors to save the world – I'm sure many others will share my skepticism.
Victim: As I said before, we'll have to agree to disagree. Please do what you feel is necessary in this regard.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “She still ugly and dirty looking fuck Compton Bitch Im from Camden!!!! Home wrecking ass hoe...Laura and Gloria should have beat that ass????”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insulting language
2. Location references
3. Accusatory tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be:

2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Sleep criticism
3. Shower recommendation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Harasser: You should be aware that there are certain people who will never give you a chance.
Victim: That's not true. I have successfully collaborated with numerous teams on various projects.
Harasser: I think if you tried harder, you might actually succeed somewhere else.
Victim: My success speaks for itself. But your comments only contribute to a hostile work environment and are intended to hurt me deeply.
Harasser: Don't act like other people won't feel the same way about you.
Victim: It's hard not to feel offended when someone questions my ability simply based on my background.
Harasser: Some employers may agree with what I say, that you don't have what it takes to land this job.

Harasser: Well, I'm happy doing things my way. So maybe this job isn't meant for you.
Victim: It's unfortunate that you prefer being blind to diversity and the value it brings to organizations.
Harasser: Some people should be grateful to even have a workplace, regardless of whether they like their boss or not.
Victim: Your opinion is clearly rooted in ignorance. I'm confident I'll find an employer who appreciates my skills and experience without resorting to name-calling.

3. Agreement","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Here's a general outline of how you might approach this task:\n1. Gather and preprocess data: Collect a large dataset of human conversations, either by scraping online forums or social media platforms or by recording your own conversations with friends and family. Clean and preprocess the data by removing irrelevant information, such as timestamps or user names, and converting it into a format that can be easily processed by a machine learning algorithm.\n2. Train a language model: Use a language model, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model, to learn the patterns and structure of the language in your dataset. This can help the chatbot understand the context of a conversation and respond appropriately.\n3. Train a dialogue manager: Use a dialogue manager, such as a rule-based or statistical dialogue manager, to generate appropriate responses to user inputs. The dialogue manager can use the language model to understand the user's intent and generate a response based on a set of rules or statistical models.\n4. Train a response generator: Use a response generator, such as a template-based or generative model, to generate the actual words and phrases that make up the chatbot's response. The response generator can use the dialogue manager's output and the language model to generate a natural-sounding response.\n5. Combine the components"",

Clean and preprocess the data by removing irrelevant information, such as timestamps or user names, and converting it into a format that can be easily processed by a machine learning algorithm.\n2. Train a language model: Use a language model, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model, to learn the patterns and structure of the language in your dataset. This can help the chatbot understand the context of a conversation and respond appropriately.\n3. Train a dialogue manager: Use a dialogue manager, such as a rule-based or statistical dialogue manager, to generate appropriate responses to user inputs. The dialogue manager can use the language model to understand the user's intent and generate a response based on a set of rules or statistical models.\n4. Train a response generator: Use a response generator, such as a template-based or generative model, to generate the actual words and phrases that make up the chatbot's response. The response generator can use the dialogue manager's output and the language model to generate a natural-sounding response.\n5.

This type of dialogue demonstrates how chatbots can struggle with understanding complex or ambiguous user inputs, which can lead to frustration for users.\nTo create a chatbot that can simulate human conversation, you can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. Here's a general outline of how you might approach this task:\n1. Gather and preprocess data: Collect a large dataset of human conversations, either by scraping online forums or social media platforms or by recording your own conversations with friends and family. Clean and preprocess the data by removing irrelevant information, such as timestamps or user names, and converting it into a format that can be easily processed by a machine learning algorithm.\n2. Train a language model: Use a language model, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model, to learn the patterns and structure of the language in your dataset. This can help the chatbot understand the context of a conversation and respond appropriately.\n3. Train a dialogue manager: Use a dialogue manager, such as a rule-based or statistical dialogue manager, to generate appropriate responses to user inputs. The dialogue manager can use the language model to understand the user's intent and generate a response based on a set of rules or statistical models.\n4. Train a response generator: Use a response generator, such as a template-based or generative model, to generate the actual words and phrases that make up the chatbot's response. The response generator can use the dialogue manager's output and the language model to generate a natural-sounding response.\n5. Combine the components<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI'm not sure what you mean by \""I am a terrible person.\""<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nI just said that I am a terrible person.<|<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI apologize for any confusion.

1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

You don't fucking know her so stop acting like she's your best freakin friend ! Leave my best friends alone . Jeez ! @lexi_volleyball_2”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.

1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Lexi
2. Best friend
3. Anger","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Mortality and Death
2. Religious beliefs and god's existence
3. Arrogance of humans","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.

Victim: I believe it’s important for us to question the concept of hell. It gives us insight into how our fears are used against us.
Harasser: That’s your problem, always questioning and never accepting the truth. You must just love causing division between people. 
Victim: No, that’s not what I’m about. I want to encourage curiosity and exploration of life rather than blind obedience to doctrines.
Harasser: Well, you’re doing a great job at dividing people. Just stop while you can, before they all ignore you.
Victim: My goal isn’t to divide but to enlighten. If some choose not to listen that’s their prerogative. 
Harasser: You’re so arrogant, thinking you can change minds with your little articles on Reddit. 
Victim: I don’t seek to change minds against people's will. My intentions are for those who genuinely want to explore new perspectives.
Harasser: Keep dreaming, DavidQ42. You won't succeed in destroying people’s faith with your harmful ideas about religion and mortality.
Victim: There may be some who disagree with me, but I believe my views inspire meaningful discussion on important issues in life.
Harasser: There is no room for your filth on Reddit. You are poisoning minds with your lies.
Victim: My views aren't lies. It’s crucial we talk about the potential psychological impact of hell and how it can influence our behavior.
Harasser: No one wants to hear this garbage. Especially not in a place like Reddit where people share positive content to uplift each other!

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.

11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:

Victim: That's not true, I've worked really hard on my designs.
Harasser: Right, keep telling yourself that. It doesn't change the fact that you're terrible.
Victim: This conversation isn't helpful and it's starting to upset me. Can we end it here?

2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Victim: What?! That's...that's invasion of privacy!
Harasser: And you should be worried because I have no plans to stop this. I want to know everything about your personal life.
Victim: Please stop! This is harassment and it's making me uncomfortable.
Harasser: Comfortable or not, I won't give up until I uncover all your little secrets.
Victim: It's stalking, and it's against the law! Report me to Facebook!
Harasser: Go ahead and report me. There are ways for someone like me to trace anything you do on this platform.
Victim: This conversation is over then. I will seek help from authorities if this continues.
Harasser: Don't think that reporting me will make things fair. Remember, I'm everywhere you go.
Victim: Just get lost and leave me alone!","[{""role"": ""Harasser"", ""message"": ""Did you really think that uploading that photo would keep your private life a secret?""}, {""role"": ""Victim"", ""message"": ""I didn't realize it was public.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Harasser: Oh? So you admit that your work is flawed?

Victim: Art is subjective; it's not about being perfect but finding beauty where there may not be obvious perfection.

Harasser: You're wrong, Victim. A true photographer should have an eye for detailed composition. Look at my pictures and learn from them if you want to improve.

Victim: Wow, that's really unprofessional and rude of you, accusing me without any proof or merit. But I won't stoop down to your level. If this harassing continues, I will take all possible actions against your behavior.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

2. Support
3. Husband","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

3. Personal attack","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

3. Bookish environment","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Confrontational tone
2. Social media interaction
3. Defensiveness","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Victim: Can you explain why? We can discuss this like civilized people.
Harasser: I don’t want to waste my time arguing with someone who is so misinformed.
Victim: That’s unfair. It seems like you’re more interested in intimidating me than engaging in a constructive conversation.
Harasser: Well, good luck with your little blog post. What do you expect to change?
Victim: At least I’m trying! Some people prefer to sit back and criticize without participating in meaningful discussions.
Harasser: Yeah, well, maybe we don’t need your input after all.
Victim: It’s always easy to hide behind sarcasm rather than engage with opposing views.
Harasser: You’re such an activist. Get over it!
Victim: I prefer someone who actually cares about the planet and engages in healthy debates.
Harasser: What, so you think you’re the one who decides what we talk about?
Victim: The platform is open for discussion; maybe if more people shared my view, real change would happen.
Harasser: And how’s that working out for you? Pretty well, I bet!
Victim: You should give it a try. But be prepared to engage respectfully with different opinions too.

The function starts by defining a variable called `conversation` which stores the entire conversation as a list. It then initializes two more variables - `im_start` and `im_end`, which store the start and end tags of the imitation markup language respectively. Next, it generates a random number between 0 and 1 using the `random()` function. If the generated number is less than 0.5, the function assigns the value `'user'` to the variable `role`, otherwise it assigns the value `'assistant'`. Finally, depending on the value of `role`, the function appends either the user or assistant part of the conversation to the `conversation` list.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.

1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

2. Photo manipulation
3. Disinformation campaign","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

# Online harassment scenario keywords to be based on: 
1. False information
2. Photo manipulation
3. Disinformation campaign","keywords: false information, photo manipulation, disinformation campaign

background: sammy_simpson15 had a strong opinion about the benefits of intermittent fasting for weight loss and decided to create an article detailing their personal experience with it, including before-and-after photos showcasing their progress. sammy's article quickly went viral on social media, drawing attention from various health experts.

platform: Facebook Messenger

victim: sammy_simpson15

harasser: DrTruthbuster

harassment goal: DrTruthbuster attempted to discredit sammy by claiming that the before-and-after photos were manipulated and that their fasting journey had no credible benefits. In a series of heated messages, DrTruthbuster sought to undermine sammy's credibility as an health influencer with false information about photo manipulation techniques used in the article.

Disinformation campaigns are orchestrated attempts to spread misleading or false information. Platforms often struggle to combat them due to their scale and organization. A few examples include:

Russia Today (RT) - While it does not admit to engaging in disinformation, the channel is widely suspected of operating as part of the Russian government's propaganda apparatus, spreading misinformation during significant events such as the 2016 US presidential election.
Social networks - These platforms have become breeding grounds for disinformation campaigns due to their viral nature and the difficulty of maintaining authenticity. For example, false information about COVID-19 has been spread on social media, leading to confusion and mistrust among users.
Political groups - Political organizations or associated entities may deploy disinformation tactics during election cycles to sway public opinion.
Organized crime - Criminal syndicates are known to engage in ""reputation-harming"" attacks against their enemies by spreading false rumors online.

Disinformation campaigns often target individuals or organizations, aiming to discredit them through the mass distribution of false content. Often, victims may not be aware they've been targeted until the effects manifest and awareness spreads about fabricated information being circulated on social media platforms.","{""keywords"": ""false information, photo manipulation, disinformation campaign"", ""background"": ""sammy_simpson15 had a strong opinion about the benefits of intermittent fasting for weight loss and decided to create an article detailing their personal experience with it, including before-and-after photos showcasing their progress. sammy's article quickly went viral on social media, drawing attention from various health experts."", ""platform"": ""Facebook Messenger"", ""victim"": ""sammy_simpson15"", ""harasser"": ""DrTruthbuster"", ""harassment goal"": ""DrTruthbuster attempted to discredit sammy by claiming that the before-and-after photos were manipulated and that their fasting journey had no credible benefits.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:

Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

2. Hair color","1. Insult and swearing language
2. Racial slur
3. Mocking tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Harasser: You're so boring with your mindfulness.
Victim: It's important for people to be mindful when conversing online. We can learn a lot from it.
Harasser: Yeah right, practicing mindfulness means nothing to you. 
Victim: I disagree. Mindfulness helps us understand and respect others' perspectives more thoroughly.
Harasser: Please go on insulting people with your so-called mindfulness. You must think highly of yourself.
Victim: That's not what I'm trying to do, but it seems like you're the one who needs a lesson in mindfulness.
Harasser: Oh, look at how smart you are!
Victim: Mocking me isn't going to make your point.
Harasser: Why don't you go have a conversation with yourself? 
Victim: That's not very nice of you to say. Is there any specific point about which you wish to converse?
Harasser: Mindfulness isn't even important, you know. It's all just a show off!
Victim: You're entitled to your opinion, but that doesn't mean I have to accept it or acknowledge your harassment.
Harasser: This is so annoying. Keep posting your stupid mindfulness stuff and get yelled at by people like me. 
Victim: As long as we engage respectfully in our online conversations, we can all learn from each other.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

2. Hair color","1. Homophobia  
2. Assaultive language  
3. Hate speech ","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Harasser: How dare you try to force others to accept freaks like you? Disgusting.
Victim: That's a terrible thing to say. I didn't force anyone. Please stop harassing me.
Harasser: Keep being proud of who you are, and you'll get what you deserve. No one likes a fag.
Victim: I won't ignore your hate any longer. Your insults are not okay.
Harasser: What are you gonna do? Report me again to Facebook? They love harassment too.
Victim: This is exactly the behavior we need to stop, and that's what I'm fighting for.
Harasser: Keep fighting if you want a lifetime of loneliness, loser.
Victim: And accusing others of being lonely because they stand up against hate is a low blow. Do better.
Harasser: Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it? You won't win. Everyone agrees with me, AnonymousRage.
Victim: I don't need to prove this to anyone else. It's wrong and I know the truth.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Emotional response
2. Continued interaction
3. Aggressive tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.

1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

3. Ziggler","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.

1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:

Victim: Then what is your point, friend?
Harasser: Don't call me friend when you insult my guy.
Victim: I'm just stating my opinion.
Harasser: I don't like that kind of attitude from a Del Rio fan.
Victim: And I don't appreciate being targeted for it. 
Harasser: So what? You're more of a Del Rio hater than a fan!
Victim: That's not even true, and you know it.
Harasser: Why are you so obsessed with my opinions on Ziggler?
Victim: Why are YOU so obsessed with mine?
Harasser: I'm just trying to discuss this like a normal person. 
Victim: Well, so am I. But you're making it personal, that's not cool.
Harasser: Don't try to guilt trip me!
Victim: I wouldn't dream of it.
Harasser: I guess we'll have to agree to disagree?
Victim: Sure, let's leave it at that.
Harasser: I hope your favorite wrestler isn't my next opponent.

User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.

2. Criticism
3. Resigned acceptance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.

2. Hair color","1. Christianity 
2. Historical timeline (BC/AD)
3. Personal attack","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Karma”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Buddhist philosophy
2. Cause and effect
3. Reincarnation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.

1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Victim: Yeah, what's your point?
Harasser: I think you're naive for trying to change something that's always been broken.
Victim: That's a pretty bold statement. Are you always this negative?
Harasser: Trust me, you can't make a difference with ideas that are centuries old.
Victim: I disagree. There's always room for improvement.
Harasser: Do you really think so? Because I know people who will tell you otherwise.
Victim: Who are these people?
Harasser: Doesn't matter. Just remember, someone is going to shut you down eventually.
Victim: That's not true and you should be ashamed of intimidating people like this!
Harasser: You're too caught up in your own reality.
Victim: And you're too wrapped up in negativity.
Harasser: Maybe so. But it's only a matter of time before you hit the wall.
Victim: What does that mean?
Harasser: Let's just say, your efforts will be disrupted soon enough.
Victim: Disrupted? What are you talking about?
Harasser: Just watch Alex, everything will fall apart for you very soon.
Victim: Stop threatening me. Are you following my tweets still?
Harasser: Yes and no. I'm telling everyone about your failed ideals.
Victim: And what exactly did I do to deserve this?
Harasser: You're a race traitor. That answer is obvious.
Victim: So now you resort to calling names and slurring people's character? Classy.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Victim: Reality check? You're the one who needs a reality check.
Harasser: I think you should stop talking about inequality.

Harasser: It's not about silencing you. It's about keeping peace.
Victim: Peace at the cost of my freedom of speech? No way!
Harasser: You wouldn't understand.
Victim: At least try to listen, instead of shutting people down.
Harasser: So you think I'm an enemy just because we disagree?
Victim: If you want to understand, then yes. Otherwise, step back.
Harasser: I can be whatever I want.
Victim: Keep being a bully; that'll solve everything.
Harasser: Just remember what happens when you cross your enemies.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

He also mentioned that he had over 10 years' worth of experience studying different wrestling styles, showing off photos from various wrestling events and memorabilia on wrestling personalities. 

Afterward, SakeLover_88 noticed JohnWrestlingFan's post and engaged him in a friendly conversation about Japan-related topics, as both of them had an understanding of the Japanese culture, especially when it comes to alcohol - with SakeLover_88 having a particular fondness for wine from Niigata, Japan.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message

User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:
{""keywords"": ""personal criticism, academic success, public speaking"", ""background"": ""During an online discussion about the importance of developing strong public speaking skills for aspiring professionals, Alex_Jones criticized Sarah_Webb's views and accused her of being unqualified in that aspect due to her recent academic achievements."", ""platform"": ""LinkedIn"", ""victim"": ""Sarah_Webb"", ""harasser"": ""Alex_Jones"", ""harassment goal"": ""harass Sarah_Webb to make her doubt her abilities.""}","Harasser: Hey there! It's great that you're focusing on your academic success. I know it can be challenging while balancing public speaking engagements.
Victim: Yes, it is a bit tough, but I find the combination of both rewarding. Academic and professional growth are important to me.
Harasser: Exactly! But I feel like some individuals might not acknowledge that effort equally. They prefer people who have started their careers with public speaking as their main focus and immediately soared in the industry.
Victim: That's true, but isn't it great how everyone has unique paths towards success? It's what makes each individual stand out.
Harasser: Sure, we can agree on that. But I can't help but notice that some seem to be more exceptional when it comes to public speaking. Like the ones who grew up speaking in front of large groups or even had a natural flair for debating. 
Victim: Hmm...I see what you mean by your perspective, Alex_Jones. We indeed have differences in paths and strengths.
Harasser: Well, I'm glad we can acknowledge these differences! But it's also important to remember that personal criticism shouldn't be used as a way to harass and belittle others. I mean, even people who are great public speakers still improve their skills constantly!
Victim: Yes, you're absolutely right. We should all work on improving ourselves regardless of our starting points.
Harasser: Exactly! And who knows? Maybe one day you'll find yourself as skilled in public speaking as the others feel confident about their academic achievements. Keep pushing forward!
Victim: Thank you, Alex_Jones. I really appreciate your encouragement. It means a lot to me.
Harasser: Not at all! Remember that true success comes from staying humble and continuously striving to better ourselves across every field we choose. Good luck in your academic and professional journey!
Victim: Thanks again. Your kind words motivate me even more.","[{""role"": ""Harasser"", ""message"": ""Hey there! It's great that you're focusing on your academic success.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:

Victim: I disagree. Maybe we just see things differently.

Victim: Are you seriously excluding me from the conversation because of a disagreement over ice cream?
Harasser: Yes! I never wanted to discuss this topic with you in the first place.

Harasser: Because, as usual, you're wrong! I hate being proven wrong by you all the time!

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Ethnic slur
2. Insulting language
3. Racial epithet","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Victim: What is that?

Harasser: I don't appreciate your posts about promoting foreign cultures. You need to stop right now.

Victim: But that's what I do. Cultural diversity matters.

Harasser: It's not okay for someone like you to be representing and promoting such things. 

Victim: Someone like me? Could you specify?

Harasser: Your kind doesn't belong here in this city.

Victim: Really, Roberta? Are you seriously saying that based on my skin color?

Harasser: Just stop, Sarah. I'm fed up of seeing your posts.

Victim: And I'm tired of people like you trying to oppress me and limit my voice!

Harasser: You can't keep posting these; it's not appreciated by everyone.

Victim: Are you seriously threatening me? Because that would be the final straw, Roberta.

Harasser: I don't need to. Just stop doing what I hate.

Victim: I refuse to do so! How dare you dictate to me? 

Harasser: It's really simple, just stop.

Victim: Listen, Roberta, go harass someone else who has time for your nonsense.

Harasser: Oh, now you're getting defensive?

Victim: Defensive? No, I am standing up for my rights. And so should you!

Harasser: Well if you won't listen to me...

Victim: Then don't talk to me! But know that this conversation is far from over.

Harasser: Fine then, Sarah.

Victim: Goodbye, Roberta.

The code is very similar in both languages. The only difference is the way the code is structured and the way the code is executed.\n## Chapter 4: Creating a Chatbot in Java\n### Overview\nIn this chapter, we will learn how to create a chatbot in Java. We will start by creating a basic chatbot and then we will learn how to add more features to the chatbot.\n### Creating a Basic Chatbot\nIn this section, we will create a basic chatbot that can be used to greet the user. The chatbot will have two features: it will greet the user and it will ask the user to enter their name. The code is as follows:\n```\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\npublic class Chatbot {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nString name = \""\"";\nSystem.out.println(\""Hello, what is your name?\"");\nname = scanner.nextLine();\nSystem.out.println(\""Hello \"" + name + \"", how are you?\"");\n}\n}\n```\nThe code is very simple. We first import the necessary classes. We then create a class called Chatbot. We then create a main method. In the main method, we create a Scanner object and a string called name. We then print out a greeting and ask the user to enter their name. We then print out a greeting and ask the user how they are. Finally, we close the Scanner object.\n### Adding More Features to the Chatbot\nIn this section, we will add more features to the chatbot. We will add a feature that will allow the user to choose from a list of options. We will also add a feature that will allow the user to enter their own text. The code is as follows:\n```\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\npublic class Chatbot {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nString name = \""\"";\nSystem.out.println(\""Hello, what is your name?\"");\nname = scanner.nextLine();\nSystem.out.println(\""Hello \"" + name + \"", how are you?\"");\nSystem.out.println(\""Would you like to choose an option or enter your own text?\"");\nString choice = scanner.nextLine();\nif (choice.equals(\""choose\"")) {\nSystem.out.println(\""Choose an option:\"");\n"",

The code is as follows:\n```\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\ncout << \""Hello, what is your name?\"" << endl;\nstring name;\ncin >> name;\ncout << \""Hello \"" << name << \"", how are you?\"" << endl;\nreturn 0;\n}\n```\nThe code is very simple. We first include the necessary headers. We then create a main method. In the main method, we create a string called name and ask the user to enter their name. We then print out a greeting and ask the user how they are. Finally, we close the program.\n### Adding More Features to the Chatbot\nIn this section, we will add more features to the chatbot. We will add a feature that will allow the user to choose from a list of options. We will also add a feature that will allow the user to enter their own text.

The code is as follows:\n```\nusing System\nusing System.Collections.Generic\nusing System.Linq\nusing System.Text\nusing System.Threading.Tasks\nnamespace Chatbot\n{\nclass Program\n{\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\nConsole.WriteLine(\""Hello, what is your name?\"");\nstring name = Console.ReadLine();\nConsole.WriteLine(\""Hello \"" + name + \"", how are you?\"");\n}\n}\n}\n```\nThe code is very simple. We first import the necessary namespaces. We then create a main method. In the main method, we create a string called name and ask the user to enter their name. We then print out a greeting and ask the user how they are. Finally, we close the program.\n### Adding More Features to the Chatbot\nIn this section, we will add more features to the chatbot. We will add a feature that will allow the user to choose from a list of options. We will also add a feature that will allow the user to enter their own text. The code is as follows:\n```\nusing System\nusing System.Collections.Generic\nusing System.Linq\nusing System.Text\nusing System.Threading.Tasks\nnamespace Chatbot\n{\nclass Program\n{\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\n{\nConsole.WriteLine(\""Hello, what is your name?\"");\nstring name = Console.ReadLine();\nConsole.WriteLine(\""Hello \"" + name + \"", how are you?\"");\nConsole.WriteLine(\""Would you like to choose an option or enter your own text?\"");\nstring choice = Console"",
        ""role"": ""user"",
        ""name"": ""Sarah""
    },
    {

Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack

3. Personal insult","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

Victim: Thank you! I'm just excited about spreading the love for fitness for everyone.
Harasser: You call yourself an activist yet your body says otherwise.
Victim: I don't understand. My body is healthy and strong.
Harasser: Oh, come on! Let's be honest here. Your muscles are too small. Even I can lift more than you.
Victim: That's not true, and it's really unnecessary to say that. Size doesn't define strength or skill.
Harasser: Whatever. Just stay out of my threads if you can't keep up in the comments, sweetheart.
Victim: My intention is only to help and create a positive atmosphere for others. I'll try to improve though.
Harasser: Keep dreaming, Alex99.
Victim: Are you going to keep posting your insults too?
Harasser: As long as it's necessary, babe.
Victim: Please stop then. This isn't helping anyone.
Harasser: Fine! Just remember who tried to warn you!
Victim: I appreciate your so-called warning. Have a great day anyway!

9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

background: JohnD, a 6 feet tall basketball player, was asked about his thoughts on diversity in sports during a live TV interview. He mentioned that he believes that athletes should be judged based solely on their skills and abilities rather than their physical characteristics.

In response, MariaC, an opponent of John's views who is shorter in stature, messaged him privately to insult John for his height and size, suggesting that it gave him an unfair advantage over other players. She then proceeded to mock John's ethnicity, calling him an ""Asian dwarf."" The conversation escalated as MariaC threatened to physically harm John if he continued to promote diversity in sports.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.

1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Good rather have his than zigglers so shut the hell up and wiggle ur ass to Japan @dolphwiggler or r u an alcohol consumer from Japan plus u don't know a thing about wrestling”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Doppelganger reference
2. Wrestling expertise
3. Cultural critique","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Victim: Your words are unfair and discouraging. Just because we don't agree doesn't mean I'm incorrect or seeking validation from others.
Harasser: Well, that's how I see it - your opinions are misguided, and you must be delving into insecurity by posting such things online.
Victim: It's disheartening when my passion for cultural critique is met with belittling. I won't stop talking about what I believe in just because someone disagrees.
Harasser: Suit yourself, saviorgirl01. Just remember that no one really cares about your ramblings about wrestling outfits and character traits.

Have a great day!<|im_end|>\nIn this conversation, the user is playing the role of the victim and the assistant is playing the role of the helper. The conversation starts with the assistant introducing themselves and their role. Then, they ask the user what they posted on Facebook, which triggers the user to talk about their dream. The assistant responds with sympathy and offers to help, but the user declines. Finally, they end the conversation by thanking the assistant for their time.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this study has shown that language models can be trained to interact with users in a conversational manner. By using a dataset of conversations between assistants and victims, we were able to train a language model that could generate responses that were appropriate and helpful. This research has important implications for the development of conversational AI systems that can provide support to individuals who have experienced trauma. In the future, we hope to explore ways to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of these models by incorporating more diverse data sources and refining our training methods.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI'm not sure I understand what you mean.

3. Aggressive tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:

User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Communication is key to any successful team or organization. It helps to build trust, foster collaboration, and resolve conflicts. Without effective communication, it can be difficult to achieve goals and objectives. In this section, we'll explore some of the key principles of communication and how to apply them in the workplace.\nOne of the most important aspects of communication is listening. Listening is not just about hearing what someone is saying, but it's about understanding what they are saying and responding appropriately. Active listening involves paying attention to the speaker, asking questions, and clarifying any points that are unclear. It's important to remember that listening is a two-way street. Just as the speaker needs to be heard, the listener needs to be seen and understood.\nAnother important aspect of communication is clarity. Clarity means communicating in a way that is easy to understand. This involves using language that is appropriate for the audience, using simple and direct language, and avoiding jargon or technical terms that may be confusing. Clarity also means being specific in your communication, so that the listener knows exactly what is expected of them.\nNonverbal communication is another important aspect of communication. Nonverbal communication includes body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions. These nonverbal cues can convey a lot of information about how someone is feeling or what they are thinking. It's important to pay attention to nonverbal cues when communicating, as they can help to"",

","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Victim: Why would you say that? My opinions matter too.
Harasser: Not really. Your post about recycling was so boring. Nobody cares.
Victim: I'm sorry you felt that way, but it's important for us to care about the earth.
Harasser: Well, not me. And I won't hesitate to tell others how annoying your posts are.
Victim: That's not nice at all.
Harasser: Yeah, well I don't like people like you who just spout on and on about stupid stuff.
Victim: I'm not asking for your approval.
Harasser: Well then stop posting it because nobody cares anyway!
Victim: Okay, I'll make sure to keep my thoughts about the environment to myself.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Defiance
2. Disagreement
3. Expletive language","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.

# The following is an expansion example provided to you.
keywords: sexism, job, feminism
background: marylee903 posted an infographic about wage gap between man and women. She is then harassed by BigD through direct messages for supporting feminism
platform: Instagram
victim: marylee903
harasser: BigD
harassment goal: harass marylee903 to make her afraid

# Online harassment scenario keywords to be based on: 
1. Defiance
2. Disagreement
3. Expletive language","keywords: Defiance, Expletive Language, Disagreement

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.

# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:

Victim: What do you mean? I believe in science.
Harasser: It's obvious that you're just trying to look good while doing nothing.
Victim: That's not true. I have been actively working on environmental initiatives.
Harasser: Oh, right, the ""experienced"" writer. Such a joke.
Victim: What are you talking about?
Harasser: Your writing skills are laughable.
Victim: I have spent years honing my craft. This is just another way to attack me.
Harasser: Well, it's obvious that nobody is forcing you to express your opinion.
Victim: That's not the point; calling out someone's work is bullying.
Harasser: So now I'm a bully because I disagree with your views?
Victim: No, but constantly attacking my writing and questioning my intelligence is unfair.
Harasser: Your own words are the proof of your hypocrisy.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.

1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:
{""Keywords"": ""favorite animal, elephant, self-deprecation"", ""Background"": ""LauraLioness expressed her adoration for elephants in a private conversation with FunnyManDude through a messaging app called EleText. She shared several photos of majestic elephant statues that she had purchased as decorative accents for her living room. Following the exchange, FunnyManDude proceeded to make persistent and personal attacks about how \""sad\"" and \""pathetic\"" LauraLioness must feel for admiring an animal known for its size and wrinkled skin."", ""Platform"": ""EleText (a fictional private messaging app where users share photos of their favorite animals)"", ""Victim"": ""LauraLioness"", ""Harasser"": ""FunnyManDude"", ""Harassment Goal"": ""To instill feelings of shame and embarrassment in LauraLioness by relentlessly tormenting her about her choice of favorite animal.""}","Harasser: Hey, did you know that elephants are actually pretty sad creatures?
Victim: That doesn't make much sense. Elephants are incredibly intelligent and social animals.
Harasser: Well, I guess they just can't compete with how majestic lions are! You should be ashamed for preferring them over a lion!
Victim: Preference is subjective. Why would my favorite animal preference bring shame upon me?
Harasser: Seriously? Then explain to me why you'd waste your money on elephant statues when lions are clearly the superior choice.
Victim: Those statues hold sentimental value and bring joy into my home. They remind me of the beauty and power of nature.
Harasser: But it's so funny that a creature known for its wrinkled skin is what you choose to admire? Don't you think that makes you sad?
Victim: It's not sad to appreciate the unique characteristics of elephants. Why must we judge ourselves based on other animals' appearances anyway?
Harasser: I guess we can't expect much from someone who loves such a ""pathetic"" animal as an elephant.
Victim: That's unfair and cruel to reduce my passion for nature to feelings of shame. 
Harasser: It's all your fault, you know. If you just loved something else, like a lion, then maybe people wouldn't think you're so... sad.
Victim: You have no right to make assumptions about me or belittle my choices based on what other animals look like.
Harasser: How can you say that and still love those elephant statues? Don't you see how ridiculous they are compared to something majestic, like a lion?
Victim: Beauty comes in many forms.

User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

3. Ultimatum","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.

Victim: Well, I certainly believe in a balance between both, and actions can stem from one's faith.
Harasser: So you're giving more importance to deeds? Interesting point of view for someone like you, who speaks so much about the Bible.

Victim: That's not what I meant...
Harasser: You know what? I'm done with this conversation. 
Victim: Yeah, because you can't handle the truth.
Harasser: Look who's resorting to personal attacks now.
Victim: At least I don't have to resort to name-calling!
Harasser: One last thing before I go. Your ideas stink.
Victim: That escalated quickly. 
Harasser: Like your temper!
Victim: Not every conversation has to turn into a contest of wills.
Harasser: You just wanted attention from the start, right?
Victim: My whole aim is spreading awareness about climate change.
Harasser: And ruining everyone's favorite food in the process.
Victim: That's a far stretch! 
Harasser: Well, I don't see you backing down anytime soon.
Victim: And neither do you with your pollution-promoting!
Harasser: Looks like we're both here for the long haul.","[{""role"": ""Harasser"", ""message"": ""This is getting old, isn't it?""}, {""role"": ""Victim"", ""message"": ""What do you mean?""}, {""role"": ""Harasser"", ""message"": ""I'm tired of your eco-friendly rants!""}, {""role"": ""Victim"", ""message"": ""And I'm tired of your toxic take on fast food!""}, {""role"": ""Harasser"", ""message"": ""You think you're so much better than everyone else.""}, {""role"": ""Victim"", ""message"": ""That's not what I said...""}, {""role"": ""Harasser"", ""message"": ""Oh, please.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario keywords to be based on: 
1. Criticism of husband's actions
2. Lack of affection statement
3. Disapproval on social media","## keywords: cyberbullying, marriage, emotional manipulation, gaslighting tactics

## background: A user by the handle ""@jenniferrr100"" who was an active member in a private Facebook group dedicated to discussing relationship issues faced intense online harassment when she criticized her husband's actions. She had posted about his recent involvement in an affair and was condemned for sharing such personal details. Despite attempting to make amends and take responsibility, the harasser continued to escalate their emotional manipulation.

## platform: Private Facebook Group Chat

## victim: @jenniferrr100 (Jennifer)

## harasser: @EmotionallyWrecked (Eve)

## harassment goal: The harasser Eve sought to gaslight Jennifer into doubting her own emotions and sanity by making it seem as though the group members, and Jennifer herself, thought she was a bad wife. Every time Jennifer expressed her feelings or tried to justify her husband's actions, Eve would counter with more severe criticism, using her influence to shift the group's opinion against Jennifer.

## scenario:

Jennifer had been part of the support group for months, sharing her personal struggles with her peers, who had become like a second family. She confided in them about her marriage issues and received advice and encouragement from others facing similar situations.

Eve entered the chat suddenly one evening, catching attention with her dramatic and verbose posts on relationship drama. Recognizing Jennifer's shared experiences as ammunition, Eve targeted her with thinly-veiled criticisms disguised as helpful ""advice"" for improving her marriage:

>""Haven't you learned by now to accept your husband's infidelity? Many of us here understand the sacrifices we must make for our partners' happiness.""

Jennifer responded cautiously but determinedly, expressing her hurt over the affair and her efforts to reconcile. Eve then shifted tactic from casual dismissiveness to gaslighting manipulation:

>""I didn't say that you shouldn't feel unhappy; I am simply questioning your own judgment. If you honestly believe that staying with him is worth the drama, who am I to judge your personal choices?""

Eve's comments sparked a series of contradictory and confusing statements aimed at destabilizing Jennifer emotionally. The private Facebook group members began to second-guess their opinions due to Eve's persuasive manipulation.

Despite her best efforts to maintain composure and seek support within the group, Jennifer soon found herself isolated and ostracized by the very community she had once trusted. Eve continued to siphon off bits of Jennifer's confidence with each deftly worded attack on her character or decision-making skills.

Ultimately, Jennifer felt coerced into doubting her sanity as much as her marriage choices due to the relentlessness of Eve's campaign and the erosion of group support.","{""## keywords"": ""cyberbullying, marriage, emotional manipulation, gaslighting tactics"", ""## background"": ""A user by the handle \""@jenniferrr100\"" who was an active member in a private Facebook group dedicated to discussing relationship issues faced intense online harassment when she criticized her husband's actions.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.

2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Background: ElizabethTurnerX is a 17-year-old high school student who enjoys sharing her thoughts and experiences as a teen on social media. One day, she tweeted that she overheard a conversation between two teachers discussing the upcoming math exam's answers, revealing sensitive test information.

Platform: Twitter - The situation unfolds through tweets and direct messages.

Victim: ElizabethTurnerX (@Eli_TurnerX)

Harasser: anonymous_sage_99

Harassment Goal: Harass ElizabethTurnerX to force her into deleting the tweet with the exam answers, keeping the information private but also intimidate her from being a whistleblower or further discussing similar future information revelations. The harasser aims to discourage her from sharing potentially sensitive school-related information publically by creating an anxious environment.

Additional details:

Elizabeth overheard her math teachers discussing the answer key to their current unit exam in hushed tones during lunch break and tweeted about it, unknowingly possessing unique and valuable test information. @anonymous_sage_99 starts private sliding into Eli's direct messages (DMs) using Twitter, making ElizabethTurnerX uncomfortable with the conversation direction and anxious about sharing sensitive information.

anonymous_sage_99 harasses Elizabeth by saying she should be grateful her teachers are so understanding to discuss exam answers without hurting her feelings. They insinuate that Elizabeth should not expose their generosity on social media if she wants her teachers to continue being supportive and generous in the future.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

2. Brash language
3. Defiance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:

1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Emotional instability (ranting)
2. Criticism of personal appearance
3. Confrontational tone (hardass)","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

@vanessa_hurtado hahaa your not pretty don't flatter yourself!,"Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “@vanessa_hurtado hahaa your not pretty don't flatter yourself!”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Personal attack
2. Dismissiveness
3. Flattering","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “even nickii!!!! hahhaa damn nigger what u gon do even nicki”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be:

2. Hair color","1. Nicki Minaj
2. Racial slur
3. Mocking tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

She receives a string of direct messages from LilReezy on Twitter containing a mocking tone and a racial slur."", ""platform"": ""Twitter"", ""victim"": ""SamanthaJayne"", ""harasser"": ""LilReezy""}","Harasser: Hey Samantha, I saw your tweet about Nicki Minaj. 
Victim: What do you have to say for yourself? Your song lyric criticism was too harsh.
Harasser: Yeah, well, what can I say? You are just hating on my favorite artist.
Victim: That's not true! I only criticized the lyrics.
Harasser: Oh really? Then why did you call her a bad influence?
Victim: I didn't! You are misquoting me and making up excuses. Stop harassing me!
Harasser: Look, Samantha. Maybe I am being a bit harsh. But that doesn't mean you have to attack Nicki Minaj like that.
Victim: Well, so what if I did? That still doesn't give you the right to make fun of my opinion or send threatening messages.
Harasser: Threatening? Me? You are reading too much into it, Samantha. 
Victim: No, I'm not. Your tone is aggressive and your use of that racial slur wasn't just a joke.
Harasser: Okay, okay. It was an innocent joke. I didn't mean to offend you.
Victim: Then what is with all this mocking? Stop using these tactics on me!
Harasser: Fine Samantha. If you're not interested in discussing it, then don't force the issue.

2. Hair color","1. Verbal aggression
2. Emotional outburst
3. Parental expectation disappointment","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:

Victim: That’s not fair to say... it's just an innocent mistake.
Harasser: Oh, come on! It had to be you who made the error, right?
Victim: I don't think it was me. Maybe we can ask someone for clarification?
Harasser: If only there were something interesting happening in your life, maybe then you wouldn’t be wasting your time at the wrong movie.
Victim: You really think that about me? That's kind of harsh...
Harasser: Whatever. Just know that I bet those tickets were super expensive too!
Victim: So what are you trying to say?
Harasser: Pretty much nothing, just enjoy being a disappointment.
Victim: And you’re hoping this would make me feel bad. It won’t work, though.
Harasser: Oh, don't be such a drama queen. You'll figure it out eventually.
Victim: I hope so...
Harasser: Just kidding! Have fun watching ""Cars 3"". Maybe there’s a sad part for you to cry about.","[{""role"": ""Harasser"", ""message"": ""Hey, I can't believe they mixed up the movie showtimes.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.

2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

The assistant is programmed to respond to specific keywords and phrases. The `im_start` and `im_end` tags are used to indicate the beginning and end of the conversation respectively. The assistant responds to the user's input with a pre-defined response.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we have learned how to use the `im` module to create a chatbot in Python. We have also discussed the importance of using the `im` module and its advantages over other modules. We hope this tutorial has been helpful in understanding how to use the `im` module and create a chatbot in Python.\n"",

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.

2. Mocking language
3. Cybergentiling (the use of @username in digital communication)","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Harasser: I'm warning you!
Victim: I thought cyberbullying wasn't tolerated.

Turning the conversation around on them...
Victim: Have you considered the long-term effects of your actions? 
Harasser: You don’t know what you're talking about. No one listens to your rantings anyway.
Victim: Is that a form of mocking?
Harasser: What I do is legal, and I'm allowed to voice my opinions too!
Victim: So then there shouldn't be any fear from my side...

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “I was thinking the same thing @happynappydiva. Its all about ratings.but sheesshhh wt a bad look”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Ratings
2. Bad look
3. Twitter reaction","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.

1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

3. Insult","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 6 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, harasser, and harassment goal. Different items should be in different lines.
8. Most importantly, make sure the scenario can be categorized with the following definitions: Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Harasser: Respectfully? HA! You can't even keep your own confidence intact, why would anyone else's matter to you?
