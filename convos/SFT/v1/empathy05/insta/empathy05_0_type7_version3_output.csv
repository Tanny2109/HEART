Ah ugly_,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Ah ugly_”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insult
2. Ugliness
3. Appearance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).

And while I don\u2019t deny their value, this doesn\u2019t seem like something for learning how to play guitar solo.\nWhat if we were able to do both learn music AND practice improvisation? Wouldn\u2019t that be perfect?\nThe answer is YES! There are plenty of ways in which you can combine these two approaches while staying within your comfort zone. In my opinion, it\u2019s always best to start with easy stuff first; nothing too difficult.\nWhat I\u2019m proposing is a list of 10 songs for guitar solo playing. These contain some elements that would be helpful when learning how to play scales, so keep all those lessons handy!\nI\u2019ve arranged them in order from easier ones (like Rock Band\u2019s \u201cThe Ballad Of Buddy Holly\u201d) up until slightly more complex pieces like Pink Floyd\u2018s \u201cComfortably Numb\u201d and Toto\u2018s timeless classic, \u201cAfrica.\u201d\nReady?

Before going there is one thing that you need to understand, it\u2019s just a theory and not really important when choosing music for yourself.\nIf you have time to read then let\u2019s get started:\nIs The Type Of Music You Listen To Matter?\nHow Does What We Listen Influence Us\nWhat Makes A Good Song According to You?\nYou\u2019ve heard the phrase \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d But how true is that with regards to what we listen? Here are a few examples of how music can influence us and our lives.\n1: It Can Influence Your Mood\nWhen it comes down to finding something upbeat or sad depending upon your mood at hand, then obviously one must be aware about this before even deciding whether going any further ahead. One may end up regretting their choice later on if they were too much focused on only certain aspects while making them feel worse off than what was needed initially planned out.\nOn the flip side though there does seem more research backing theory behind feeling happier after playing some nice tunes for yourself; no matter how bad things might be.\nThis could mean that getting lost in your favorite songs during these moments when everything seems terrible will help push through any sort of rough patch easier than if you wouldn\u2019t want anything positive around anyway? In other words, this is just another benefit which comes along with spending time listening music everyday!\n2: It Could Even Influence Your Brain Chemistry\nIt\u2019s interesting to think how long-term exposure can influence mood when it comes down playing some tunes that are more upbeat or sad depending upon your personal preference.\nThere might not actually be anything proven as of yet though there does seem pretty much like if you\u2019re going deep into something where lyrics are singing about bad times then this could help put things into perspective, and even make life feel better after spending time with them before moving away from said subject matter.\n3: The Influence On Your Emotions Is Real\nYou know that listening to music can influence your mood. So if you\u2019re not a fan of depressing or angry songs try swapping out any playlists containing those types for more upbeat tunes instead and see"",

The effects depend on individual taste though so there\u2019s no one-size fits all approach here \u2013 but at least now we know this much since reading through everything right?\nAt the end it just comes down whether you\u2019re happier after listening or feeling even worse off than before trying out something new.\nSo don\u2019t worry about what other people will think because in my eyes, anyone who doesn\u2019t appreciate certain kind of music doesn\u2019t get to judge someone else\u2019s preferences in their own life either way!\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten the basics down\u2026let me ask you a question: Is there really just one \u201cperfect\u201d type or genre I can listen to if I want results?\nIt all depends on your personality and what types are likely going make things worse instead of better, at least according some research studies (which may not even be right anyway).\n6: It Affects Your Memory Too!\nHave you ever heard the phrase that music affects memory? Well it does! There\u2019s actually quite a bit of evidence in both psychology books as well other academic publications about how certain frequencies can influence our mood based off what they have been proven time and again with studies.\nBut I think everyone who listens on some basis gets this because when we\u2019re feeling low most would rather hear soothing sounds than anything too stimulating or distracting, right?, which means listening has more potential effects here without realizing beforehand that one song might make people depressed where another causes them not care at all.\nSome argue that music is a language and can be used to convey"",

Some even say it affects memories though there isn\u2019t strong evidence for this idea either way yet \u2013 but maybe if they got more support from psychologists researching related topics then we could find out whether listening does anything special.\n7: Music Can Influence Your Perception\nDid you ever notice how music can have a huge effect on perception? It\u2019s true \u2014 if I play uplifting tunes during my workouts, then it definitely helps push myself harder and get better results than doing the same thing with no background noise at all or any other type which are more relaxing instead.\nAnd as far as what makes something good enough so that we feel energized even when running on treadmill?\nWell there doesn\u2019t seem much research into how different things affect people mentally, but some have gone out of their way suggesting things like heavy metal and drum \u2018n\u2019 bass (although not many psychologists would be able agree).\nI\u2019d say this comes down personal preference more than anything though because what makes great for one might make another feel depressed or annoyed so it\u2019s pretty much up to everyone in the end \u2013 but some people just don\u2019t seem happy unless they\u2019re listening hardcore rock while being put through rigorous exercise routines.\n8: The Influence Of Different Genres Is Real Too\nThere are different ways that music affects our mood based on which genre we listen. Some songs get us pumped and ready for anything, others help calm anxiety or stress levels down. Listening to classical instrumental piano pieces can relax you in no time at all if that\u2019s your thing \u2013 but again everyone has their own individual preferences.\n9: So Does Genre Really Matter That Much In The End?\nWell it depends on who we\u2019re talking about as some say there needs to be a certain sound quality or genre (heavy metal, drums \u2019n\u2019 bass) for someone feel good and pumped up while other types seem more effective when going through difficult times so don\u2019t stress over this if you can find something that works without caring where it falls on a scale.\nThe most important thing is just finding what makes YOU happy enough after listening since personal preference takes priority here as much anything else anyway! So relax and enjoy yourself while exploring new types until discover which one truly feels right \u2013 but hopefully by now you won\u2019t mind trying almost any style either because they\u2019ve all been proven to affect us differently (and usually without realizing we\u2019re even affected).\nThere are many factors that influence our taste of music.

The sound is not too bad but I am looking to improve things so that it becomes more bearable for others when they\u2019re around .\nThere aren\u2019t any neighbors who live nearby but some close friends do drop by all the time (we don\u2019t get drinks together on weekends either).\nAnyway, here\u2019s an update about my band practice noise problem and how your guide has been a huge relief:\nI\u2019ve gone through many different types of speaker systems already \u2013 from ones that have had bad reception to some with very high fidelity sound quality. My latest attempt is pretty good though; but they\u2019re still not perfect.\nThe worst part was really just trying them out in my house first without getting permission from neighbors because otherwise people might complain! It always makes me nervous if we start practicing right away (but fortunately I\u2019m lucky enough no one bothers). Sometimes when someone does come over there\u2019s usually an awkward silence before someone asks what goes on back here and they end up inviting themselves inside lol.\nAnyway this kind of thing only happens maybe once every other session though so yeah hopefully soon things will quiet down even more! Also another funny story happened recently:\nOnce again it was right after work when all my friends were over hanging out before dinner time. We had just started playing something new but then one guy says \u201cyou know you\u2019re really loud guys.\u201d That totally caught us off guard because well we weren\u2019t making any noise at all (even though clearly someone could hear).

There\u2019s no way I could tolerate playing along and singing at the same time while keeping up with all those chords being strummed! It can feel like someone is stabbing me right through the head \u2013 which isn\u2019t what anyone wants on a regular basis after work hours or weekend fun times right?\nAfter doing my own research online I\u2019ve come across some pretty good options, but they\u2019re not cheap. For acoustic music lovers you already know how hard it can be to find something that will mute your favorite type of instrument.\nThe problem is: if we go out there and buy just about anything with reviews saying these were created by people who actually care, chances are very likely that I\u2019ll end up being too overwhelmed because most likely the sound still penetrates my ears no matter what brand or type they use \u2013 which makes it pretty pointless overall. That said; do you think any speaker systems actually work?\nIf so then what kind of music should we focus on when choosing different speakers for both loud instruments as well as quieter types such as acoustic guitar sounds?\nYou are definitely right in that there is a lot to be worried about with all the noise pollution around us everywhere and it can\u2019t help but add up if you practice 5 days every week.\nIf your current neighbors don\u2019t mind then I would suggest checking out what kinds of speakers work best for each particular type of musician or band members. There\u2019s no way that one speaker will do everything for someone who plays acoustic guitar as well, so depending on how much noise is coming from different types at regular intervals throughout your week.\nI\u2019ve got a lot to answer here! In short and quick words: YES (some good options are listed below), but only if they\u2019re compatible with what you enjoy playing because some instruments just can\u2019t be muted by any electronic device or sound"",

But don\u2019t worry too much about that though \u2013 most speakers really do help even out the balance while keeping everything sounding smooth overall.\nA few things need to take into account before deciding exactly which type will work best since this totally depends on personal preference. Here\u2019s what I have found works for me and hopefully it\u2019ll give you some insight as well!\nSo if anyone starts wondering whether they can hear us through our soundproofing methods then tell them we\u2019re just playing music with no vocals \u2013 that way there won\u2019t be anything to worry about or feel bad over since nothing was hurtful at all.\n1st option: Sound Barrier Wall System\nThe sound barrier wall is one solution, but it probably wouldn\u2019t do too much for acoustic instruments because you still need to consider how they\u2019re making their noise. If the music comes from a certain instrument then I suggest checking if there\u2019s any way possible that can be muted or played in isolation without disturbing other neighbors so everyone ends up happy with each others decisions!\n2nd option: Speakers \u2013 Passive & Active Systems\nPassive systems are pretty basic and usually come in sets of two (L/R) which you place on either side of the speakers. They\u2019re much cheaper than active solutions I\u2019ll explain next, but it also means that they won\u2019t provide nearly as good quality sound for anyone listening through headphones or near by.\nActive speaker systems include amplifiers with some type of DSP processing to adjust frequency response and levels between channels so everything sounds more balanced across all ranges while still being loud enough without becoming too much. These are usually pretty expensive depending on model you get, but I can say in my experience when it comes to acoustic guitar playing they offer the best sound quality \u2013 especially if your neighbors don\u2019t mind low volume!\nHow To Soundproof My Apartment From Neighbor\u2019s Noise?\n5 Places That May Be The Source Of Your Noisy Neighbors\nNeighbour Has Loud Amplified Music System: What Should I Do?"",

But let yourself take a breather before rushing off and figuring things out. There are more effective ways than others depending on where speakers were placed \u2013 so don\u2019t worry about them being too loud if only it\u2019s coming from one end of the room while everyone is gathered at another!\nThere may also be certain instruments that make it easier on both you and neighbors alike (assuming they aren\u2019t super noisy). For instance, some guitars tend to pick up sound from walls or ceiling more readily than others \u2013 meaning any noise will travel around much faster! Not just straight towards wall/ceiling either; but anywhere within a 45 degree angle radius right next along with it. This makes things especially tricky if your neighbors live above you since vibrations could easily transfer through floor boards if they start shaking too hard.\nI hope my explanation helps illustrate how important proper placement really is \u2013 which means not just considering one side of an apartment building where only windows face out (though even that can make some difference). It\u2019s much better having two walls between rooms instead because then no matter what your neighbors do upstairs or downstairs, nothing could travel back down there and bother anyone who happens to be sleeping over.\nIn fact: If I didn\u2019t know any better I\u2019d wager good money those guys were using all kinds of speakers strategically placed throughout house so their noise would only go forward; not backwards. But maybe we\u2019ll never know for sure until someone asks\u2026\nThis is a more common issue than one might imagine \u2013 especially after moving into an apartment or loft with thick walls that are soundproofed from the ground up down to concrete!\nMost people think they will be safe because it sounds like there\u2019s another world between you and your neighbors, but in reality everything still vibrates (including pipes) making even small noises travel back again.\nI hope this doesn\u2019t apply too much here considering the way things are laid out; but if anyone should end up on top floor facing away then just know that nothing would prevent any noise from coming through! It\u2019s best to be prepared for worst-case scenario since sometimes we don\u2019t get a say in where neighbors live \u2013 especially when it comes down right next door.\nNow let me ask you\u2026 Do your neighbors seem like ones who might keep an ear out?

Maybe we should take time talking through this with anyone concerned since everyone has different levels of tolerance when faced similar situations \u2013 unless it\u2019s just noise caused by dogs barking outside instead (that can\u2019t help but be heard).\nIf anything though, I\u2019d probably still recommend buying something small while discussing options anyway to try on our own first so you guys could get a feel for how loud each is before moving forward with anything larger if necessary. After all: who knows what\u2019ll happen or change down the line after talking through this whole issue either way \u2013 including where any speakers actually end up being placed (since depending upon where it\u2019s set will determine whether your guitar sound travels towards wall/ceiling as well).\nAs you can see, there are a lot of factors that need to be taken into consideration when choosing equipment for acoustic music lovers who wish to play their favorite tunes loud enough without disturbing the peace and quiet around them.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

The answer to that should be pretty straight forward and even though some will claim religion makes them act differently without any sort of personal incentives, you cannot explain why it would make such a difference as well.\nI just want to say i'm not angry or anything at least not with you but if someone else on this forum is trying to provoke me then I'd love to know who that person might be.

Also even though I might tend to agree and think of all religions as wrong it doesn\u2019t mean that they will all eventually disappear.

Did you really just say there was evidence for the metaphysical? What are you talking about? This is a fact - Atheists do not rely on material methods of knowledge. In other words we don't have beliefs taken from things we hear and read like most people in this country tend to as best i know.\nTo be honest I fail see how one would consider all evidence for things which can\u2019t be proven by mere logic or science \""material\"" but perhaps it's that part you didn't understand instead?\nWhat on earth are you talking about?

There is no way the vast majority of people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying when claiming things like this so why can't they provide any evidence?\nI never made that claim and i actually think Islam is much more likely than Christianity to continue on for a long time especially in countries where it's already an established religion however I would still bet my money against most claims of the religious kind. There\u2019s no way the vast majority of people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying when claiming things like this so why can't they provide any evidence? Not only is there none but i doubt a lot wouldn\u2019t claim that some was.\nThe answer to your question lies in something you may not have considered: the fact that we live in an extremely religious world. The majority of people believe, and many consider it to be self-evident truth or common sense that God/Gods exist.

Especially when you\u2019re doing so in front of everyone else as well which will likely make people think twice before calling someone an 'atheist' again unless they really want him/her too.\nAtheism simply means lack of belief in God or gods. It's not saying that you have to disprove the existence of god/gods, it is merely stating what you choose to believe or refuse to believe.\nWe should consider the psychological effects of being called \u201catheists\u201d: A lot more people know that calling someone a homosexual or faggot will probably make them feel uncomfortable than calling someone an atheist. This could possibly be due to the fact that no one really wants to admit they\u2019re both an outlier when it comes to their sexual preferences and religious/spiritual beliefs (at least not without proper cause). While I am obviously assuming all atheists are happy with being called \u2018atheist\u2019 a lot may feel uncomfortable about it.\nWhen someone calls another person (or group) by what most consider offensive name then it is in his/her interest that the receiver feels offended.

However when that person knows they might have a religious (or at least spiritual) belief system which makes him or her uncomfortable then there will be doubt in their mind of what could motivate the caller. After all if he/she were merely trying to state an opinion wouldn't it just be easier for them explain that too? If something is meant as some type non-threatening communication attempt why would you choose such a harsh phrase?\nYou\u2019re right about how atheists do not have any positive experiences which might encourage belief in God or gods but I think you will both agree on what they need: They want their beliefs (or lack thereof) accepted by everyone else.

We do it by observing physical evidence of cause & effect interactions between all particles and radiation which comprises this space time continuum we inhabit now.\nYou can say \""atheist\"" to me 8 times more often than any religious label; I'm happy that you understand my beliefs. It's not like calling someone a \""nigger\"", or any other racial term, in today's environment; it really should just be about having respectful conversations.\nI mean people who don't know the facts about atheism don\u2019t call atheists by name so yes to some degree we can say they are all at least subconsciously motivated with negative intent and even if this is not always true then one would need a great deal of knowledge about a particular person in order for it still apply.\nThere's no real point to responding anymore. What I originally meant was simply that because you don't have faith in anything, which means your beliefs stem from personal experiences rather than 'faith'. This applies to every atheist (or at least all non-believers who aren't just ignorant), whether they are open-minded towards others or not.\nOf course, calling someone \""atheist\"" isn't like saying the word \""nigger\"". That's a ridiculous comparison. I never claimed it was an equivalent offense and that doesn't mean my feelings are hurt by being called atheist either.\nWhen is someone going to tell him that he has no clue?\nIt should be noted however that all people (including many atheists) tend to consider religion as something more important for the well-being of society than non-believers do, which might explain why it remains so common in both private and public spheres despite not being relevant anymore in most cases.\nSo while there may still some believers who value their faith above everything else they also share this view since even just thinking about how others think can make a believer question whether or not God exists too.

This response will determine whether they feel comfortable enough with their non-beliefs to share them with anyone else again, even if it\u2019s just for conversation sake.\nYou don\u2019t have religion therefore why would you make a public claim about someone having faith? You\u2019re assuming something here without asking though; so your argument could also count as unfounded bias.\nWell I suppose we all find some things more insulting than others but the point is that calling non believers these types of names will most likely hurt their feelings. This can be especially true if they've recently lost a loved one who was religious or have otherwise been feeling vulnerable about it because society doesn't respect them as much for what they do not believe. I\u2019m not even saying non-believers should feel threatened by such comments either, just that someone else might see something different there from what you think he or she will.\nYes and no: While I don\u2019t call myself atheist I can only assume the reason why would be either because the term itself includes an insult based on one having a lack of faith in some higher power (which means anything with supernatural elements like ghosts etc..) , but also due to all that comes along with it, namely not believing at any point during life.\nIn this case both are true since someone calling them atheist is implying they don't have a belief or rather discredits their beliefs from existing if you really think about it while it's just part of human nature now days for people to call others who aren\u2019t religious 'atheists.'\nOn another note what does 'religious based' mean? What type do we see so often in our countries today because there are some that have been around since time began such: like shamanism, animism and ancestor worship which don't really fit into any of your modern belief structures I guess; therefore I'm not sure how these fall under definition as being \u2018religious.\u2019 But anyway you\u2019re right this is just a technicality when"",

In fact most could argue we're discussing religion's current psychological effects on humanity since if someone fears being threatened for simply speaking their mind as it relates specifically to god then of course that person won\u2019t have a religious belief system with which they feel comfortable holding anyway (which means by definition this conversation actually touches upon the subject).\nThe only reason I didn't focus in on people who fear retribution is because it isn't necessary since we cannot know whether someone feels threatened simply from calling them atheist unless he/she tells us"",

So while there is nothing wrong per se though about being an \""atheist\"" nor does calling someone such carry more meaning than simple fact that this means we aren't religious (ie do not believe in God), it seems almost everyone finds some discomfort around term at least slightly if asked directly.\nI don\u2019t know if you want to debate whether certain people should be considered as atheists or not anymore since there really isn't much point given what was implied by me already earlier. But anyway for those who share my perspective on this definition i think it would most accurately apply specifically when talking about someone whose lack of faith makes them such (ie doesn't define their life in any other way). The reason I use this term even though not everyone identifies with it directly is because no one shares your same beliefs anymore regarding what counts as being non-religious anyway so whether there are good reasons to consider yourself atheist becomes irrelevant beyond saying you don\u2019t believe something.\nTherefore from my perspective when I made comparison between atheists and homosexuals both groups could be viewed negatively by majority based on how everyone else considers them (ie do not share their views) since this is true even if only speaking about a small subset of either population. Anyway the reason why they weren't comfortable labeling themselves directly or indirectly was that doing so implies these individuals don\u2019t follow traditional paths others expect from people who believe what\u2019s considered right/wrong; which means society judges anyone else differently as well due to differences between how everyone interacts despite believing similar things overall (ie doesn't matter if my sister goes out drinking all night long).\nIn other words I'm trying say there won\u2019t be such thing anymore called \u201catheist\u201d just like some would argue same about gay since even those who don\u2019t follow certain religious paths can now identify more closely in terms of sexual orientation.\nWhat"",

What I am trying say is that although someone might want another individual calling them by same term, he or she probably doesn\u2019t think very much anymore about what word means to anyone besides herself once they've lived without sharing this view publicly long enough for it not matter anymore either way.\nAnd in response to your final paragraph: This kind of thing happens all the time but does saying something bad after being accused imply there was never anything wrong with said person or behavior before? Not necessarily; plus most wouldn\u2019t admit their misdeeds regardless if you are accusing them based on fact (ie can't know what anyone else is doing behind closed doors), so there isn't any benefit in discussing these types of things anyway since I'm sure majority would assume even if someone doesn\u2019t do anything wrong he or she will deny such accusations simply because most people have a hard time believing they could ever act differently when no evidence to support claim (which makes sense given both parties involved often lie).\nNo I don't want for there not be discussion about what constitutes an atheist. That would make my original concern completely irrelevant, now wouldn't it? The point is that people should consider their own beliefs carefully before calling someone else who doesn\u2019t share them by name as you can clearly see from the very first message where this conversation began (ie do we want more reasons for others to think negatively about not believing what\u2019s right/wrong?). I\u2019m sure you won't take offense when hearing someone say something bad after being accused unless he or she has done wrong though since most wouldn\u2019t respond differently even if everything was true since it's harder imagining themselves acting in ways they don\u2019t agree with (ie can assume person is lying), so there isn't any benefit discussing these types of things anyway"",

What I'm worried is how often someone feels like he or she can't talk openly about anything with others without fearing they might respond based solely on belief system rather than logic alone (which means there will likely never be widespread adoption regarding what counts as \u2018faithfulness\u2019 even though most people share some idea). The point isn\u2019t whether calling someone else 'atheist' implies more accurately what everyone considers them since this has already happened regardless if few care enough to bother changing their minds so long as they don't feel negatively defined themselves.\nAnd that's the end for such topics since I am done discussing anything further regarding why people should avoid using language meant solely for religious discussions unless ready to consider consequences first; plus there isn\u2019t any reason arguing over what constitutes an \u2018atheist\u2019 anymore if most share similar outlooks already despite not always calling others by this term (ie can't say much about how those who don\u2019t want their beliefs doubted will continue living). You're free however to tell me how wrong I am based on any good reasons discussing these types of things in future posts though since doing so is more important than simply repeating everything everyone knows already anyway.\nAnd one last thing regarding whether something bad implies person doesn't act differently when no evidence exists for belief (ie can assume he or she lied): This kind of assumption happens all the time, especially with religious people who believe they don\u2019t lie because God would never judge them negatively even if someone thinks otherwise after speaking out against their behavior. Most also wouldn't respond any differently despite being accused since there is really no way to know what anyone does alone inside head anyway and therefore can only guess (which means doesn't matter for determining truth).\nI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t clear enough; The reason why you should avoid using words meant solely for religious conversations unless ready to consider consequences first has little if nothing at all do with whether someone else shares them or not though since this will always remain open topic regardless if your definition of what counts as \u2018atheist\u2019 becomes widely accepted over time (ie can't say much about how those who don\u2019t want their beliefs doubted yet won\u2019t stop sharing).

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Global mean sea level rose by around six inches in the past hundred years \u2013 it has risen more than half an inch since 2001, but still less than five times as much in just over a year! (The current rate of increase is around one tenth of one foot in fifty-five years.) It\u2019s mostly due to thermal expansion. Glaciers have been shrinking and sea ice declining for decades (it\u2019s even going the other way now!), although Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets aren\u2019t melting faster than 2 inches per year; you\u2019re wrong about glaciers being more stable with global temperature.\nThe sun is very important in climate changes, which started billions of years ago. It makes everything from a warm atmosphere to liquid water necessary for life. We evolved as humans because the sun heated us up and made us able to have fur (and eat animals that had fur), live in trees, etc.; not all organisms even do this.\nYou\u2019re right about the moon\u2019s effect on tides \u2013 we measure its distance from Earth every day at a place called an \u201cobervatory.\u201d We use radio signals bounced back off a dish shaped like half of a parabolic mirror; it looks almost exactly like one of those satellite dishes you see in parks which has nothing to do with astronomy. That\u2019s why it only costs money that we spend on telescopes!\nA lunar eclipse doesn\u2019t block light from the Sun; rather, Earth orbits between Sun and Moon during nighttime (and most time), so all the sunrises look like they\u2019re moving out of view behind us! However, when there is no shadow cast by mountains or clouds at this point, then we see what\u2019s known as a ring around the entire Moon \u2013 called either \u201ctotality\u201d if it happens on land; otherwise just an annular solar eclipse if not visible here because Earth doesn\u2019t completely block everything except its center.\nYou\u2019re right that greenhouse gases are important: they trap heat from the surface before it reaches us or radiates out into space where there wouldn\u2019t be enough left to get through all those molecules again without being absorbed somewhere else instead. I forgot about carbon dioxide! And water vapor is much higher than some sources say because of humidity levels in different parts depending on what part you take as well\u2026\nIt\u2019s not true that CO2 concentration correlates with global temperature over long periods \u2013 there are cycles when one rises more quickly or faster; it takes time for any changes to get through the system"",

A lot depends on what kind people are going down, how many resources exist while demand increases etc., but if things don\u2019t improve soon (which seems likely), there may come a point where life itself becomes unsustainable due mainly to effects caused by our own actions such as increased atmospheric CO2 levels & rising temperatures leading eventually into irreversible environmental shifts like those seen previously during periods when humans weren't even present yet anyway because animal species went extinct en masse. -The question whether it is possible for human beings who live in countries where there currently aren't enough natural resources needed already exists will still have more later on since demand from elsewhere also increases etc.. And if they ever get rich enough that doesn't mean these kinds of problems automatically go away either because people keep trying harder until finally someone finds something worth doing even though others don't agree; otherwise nothing good happens besides just getting richer without making things better than before which really only benefits a few privileged individuals.\nYes, I know the world is still heating up!\nGlobal warming does not stop over night. It\u2019s still happening now as we speak! The IPCC predicts further temperature rise of 1 degree C by the end of this century \u2013 and if humans don\u2019t take immediate measures in order to lower their emissions than an increase twice as high (2 degrees) could occur instead. This would change everything: ice is melting faster; sea levels are rising even more quickly\u2026\nThe oceans will become acidic which means many coral reefs may die off, while other parts where they used to grow now have no way survive because acidity goes down when carbon dioxide enters water molecules themselves becoming ions inside those who happen contain calcium carbonate shells like shellfishes do! There were several massive extinctions during prehistoric times that occurred only due precisely what happened earlier too! And there will likely be more unless we take immediate action today so humans don\u2019t end up following suit eventually someday\u2026"",

So yeah, don\u2019 expect too many changes happening anytime soon while still expecting lots coming eventually if anybody gets paid for finding answers about global warming since we\u2019re not rich enough yet to get everything done correctly like during wars and such.\nHumans are selfish by nature so it\u2019s hard predicting how they\u2019ll react to things that could go wrong or right depending where you live on the planet which means nobody knows what might happen with any prediction until something bad occurs requiring fixing from everybody working together despite most people not caring about saving Earth. But if everything gets better who cares then? It doesn\u2019 mean anything unless there were problems beforehand for this all to make sense\u2026\nSince nothing is sure about predicting even I\u2019ll try sharing my expectations since nobody paid me\u2026 The only thing certain seems like global warming will probably get worse before it gets any easier but that isn\u2019t enough knowing everything will turn against your hopes so expect something bad happening eventually regardless what happens here today for the future.\nUntil some kind of disaster occurs forcing everybody working together towards fixing problems there\u2019s hardly anything possible unless lots more money goes into finding answers however most humans aren\u201d even interested caring much about saving Earth which means nobody is going to solve issues like global warming anytime soon no matter how likely it might become after years pass if somebody gets paid doing research while not giving away findings right now like during last winter where few people expected cold conditions everywhere for such extended periods\u2026\nWe can\u2019t predict anything without knowing everything since there\u2019s always chance for surprises coming out of nowhere so don\u2019 expect your predictions turning correct no matter what happens here today unless something unexpected occurs forcing everybody working together towards"",

Home wrecking ass hoe...Laura and Gloria should have beat that ass????”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insulting language
2. Location references
3. Accusatory tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

In this book, I\u2019ll explain everything from what kitchen utensils are and how they work, to the best ways and reasons for cutting vegetables in different shapes.\nWe'll cover a variety of techniques\u2014like saut\u00e9ing\u2014and go over the basics so even if you're already an excellent cook, there\u2019ll still be some new stuff here that will really impress your friends. And don\u2019t worry\u2014if I throw too many kitchen terms around or use words you don't understand right away, that's fine! Just put a bookmark in this book and then continue on with other titles so that by the time we come back to it all these crazy cooking words won\u2019t be such mystery anymore.\nBy reading this book closely and practicing (and maybe using our app along the way), over time you'll really become an amazing cook. When people see your beautiful dishes they\u2019re sure to say, \u201cWow! You were able to make that?\u201d\nAnd who knows? Maybe by then we can all get together for a big feast!\n# Chapter 1: The Kitchen and Its Tools\nYou\u2019ll be using many different kitchen tools to help you turn simple ingredients into delicious meals. So it\u2019s important to learn about your most commonly used utensils before starting out.\nThere are two main types of knives:\nThis is the all-purpose knife. It has a wide blade (around 6 in [15 cm] or more) that allows for easy cutting and chopping, as well as slicing thin pieces into strips by holding it perpendicular to the vegetable/fruit you\u2019re cutting against an unyielding countertop.\nThis knife has a skinny, pointed tip that\u2019s perfect for paring. Its small size lets you cut delicate vegetables like radishes or potatoes. The blade isn\u2019t sharp enough for all-purpose use but is very useful on soft produce because its narrowness allows it to work in tight spaces.\nHere are descriptions of the three main types of pans:\nThese thin metal pots are perfect frying, boiling, saut\u00e9ing, and steaming foods. There\u2019s also a shallow flat top version that cooks food using just hot fat/oil called a \u201cpan\u201d\nIf you haven\u2019t heard about these, we\u2019ll get to them in detail in chapter 2! In essence though they\u2019re an even thinner metal pan than saut\u00e9es but with straighter sides so nothing can fall out. They make great dishes for stovetop"",

Their shallow depth helps the food inside evenly get hot, while its wide surface area allows for lots of ingredients to be used at once, which is essential when you\u2019re trying out new recipes!\n# Chapter 2: Basic Techniques\nWhen slicing, chopsticks are more popular because they're easy and don't require much movement. However, if someone wants to make the food look good or cook quickly then a knife will come in handy.\nParing knives are ideal for cutting delicate produce into small pieces (like tomatoes). Use this technique when serving as part of an appetizer or using on its own with other foods like salads.\nThis is an important skill that we'll go over later!\nThe first step to saut\u00e9ing is heating a pan with oil so it has some sort of fat and will get hot enough without burning your food. Place the ingredients inside, stir occasionally with utensils such as wooden spoons until they're done cooking while making sure not to scrape off from what was burnt before adding more oil if needed!\nWhen boiling something on stovetop boil water first (don't heat up any other kind of fluid) then place whatever foodstuffs into saucepan, simmer gently for about ten seconds with lid overtop of them so they remain submerged but don\u2019t let boil over. Simmer covered until done cooking - this technique works best when there aren\u2019t too many items to cook simultaneously!\nThis process gets your meals ready in a jiffy! When using the microwave you need something called \u201cmicrowaving-safe\u201d that will withstand high temperatures without melting or exploding onto other surfaces.\nA great way of cutting vegetables into thin, even slices is by using either a food processor with slicing function attached OR pre-chopping some ingredients and then passing them through a machine to get uniformly sized pieces every time!\n# Chapter 3: The Cooking Basics\nCooking is the act of using heat for making edible meals. It\u2019s one of those things that just about everyone needs to know how do\u2014so what better way than learning it right now?!\nThere's no need to cook up a storm when you're working with vegetables and fruit. Just add enough liquid (oil or other) on each side for an even roast without burning your meal.\nThis cooking method works best if the vegetable is cut into chunks of similar sizes because all pieces will evenly fry in oil at same time, making sure they get cooked"",

Plus there are safety considerations too\u2014always remember that oil splatter everywhere which may cause burns if not handled properly.\nHere's a list of some kitchen tips you'll wanna keep in mind while learning the ins-out:\nKeep your ingredients out when cutting and chopping so they don't move around as much, it makes for an easier time making evenly measured pieces;\nUse plastic containers instead aluminum foil because heat is easily conducted into food by metallic material which might give off a metal taste in some cases. Aluminum can also react with acidic foods producing foul odor.\nThe pan should be the same size as your vegetables/fruit so that there isn\u2019t too much liquid or oil going around before they brown up nicely without creating excess smoke which may pollute air quality during preparation process;\nKeep cooking utensils clean and sterile at all times, to avoid cross-contamination with other ingredients that are being prepared separately in different parts of the same space - this includes any surfaces where raw meat was touched.\n# Chapter 4: Let's Try the Techniques!\nNow we\u2019re going over all three techniques from chapter 2! But remember that it\u2019ll take some practice so don\u2019t try getting perfect your first or only time. Be sure to review the process and experiment until things feel solid\u2014and if you run into problems with any one step in particular, I\u2019ve included a few troubleshooting tips to get back on track!\nStep one is cutting up veggies! Cut them into large chunks that will fit into your cooking pot.\nIf it's too hard because of being really tough or frozen then defrost first before starting this process.\nPlace the food items (fruit/vegetables) so they are evenly spaced out inside pan; set burner to medium-high heat until water starts boiling while continuously stirring gently during entire cooking procedure. This technique works best when there aren't many different ingredients mixed together in one pot since it can become difficult if you add some things at specific intervals instead of all together.\nUse a knife and cutting board for slicing or chopping vegetables/fruit into small pieces, which is more time-consuming than other ways that don\u2019t require an expert knife wielder. If there's anything I've learned with my years as a chef it\u2019s this: if you have sharp knives then everything will go much faster!\nIf oil starts smoking"",

The end goal here is getting pieces that look like one big piece with no gaps anywhere except at seams where edges come together in mouthwatering way. That's when the magic happens!\nThis technique can be difficult because there are many options for liquids to use, including water or stock instead of oil depending on what type of meal you're making etc...so it pays off not only know how much but also which kind. Use about half as much again more than what would normally go into cooking pan if just trying normal way without any added fats/sauces/stir-ins like we\u2019ve done previously.\n# Chapter 5: What are the Main Types of Sauces You Should Know How to Make?\nA delicious sauce can take your dish from good, all the way up and down. And since knowing how they work is pretty much key when dealing with any type of recipe involving liquid\u2014whether in cooking meat or vegetables\u2014you\u2019ll be able for sure get ahead by learning now.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard about these before but not realized that \u201csauce\u201d means it\u2019s basically just food mixed with liquids! This includes ketchup and mayo which are basically condiments (and I guess we could say the same thing for mustard), as well as anything else typically spread onto sandwiches. Other items that fit into this category include gravy, salad dressing.\nThis type of sauce is made by adding liquid to ingredients like fat/oil then slowly cooking until it reaches desired temperature. The name comes from French \u201csaison\u201d which simply means seasonings used in making most sauces so if someone refers specifically\nto something being a \""seasoning\"" don't get confused because that would just mean another word for sauce!\nThis is where the secret ingredient of booze does its magic with ingredients like butter and cream to create an incredibly rich flavor profile. Common types are b\u00e9chamel (a French one), mornay, hollandaise or Velout\u00e9 which add additional layers upon themselves without any need for thickening agents - hence why they're sometimes called 'cream sauces'.\n# Chapter 6: Let's Make Some Sauces!\nThe following recipes should make around a half cup of sauce per serving in the best way possible. That means some cooking time, but it\u2019ll still be quick\u2014and with great results on any dish you serve them up.\nFor this we'll need butter and white flour"",

Mix together 1 tablespoon of cornstarch or all-purpose in a small bowl until smooth then add your hot liquid slowly while stirring constantly so it doesn't clump up; let simmer for about five minutes before adding salt and pepper if desired.\nFor this recipe, we'll start with a roux. Roux is simply equal parts butter to flour (and don\u2019t worry\u2014you won\u2019t need too many ounces). Heat the pan on medium low heat then slowly add chopped onions into it as they begin cooking together for about 15-20 minutes until soft but not browned - this will take longer than your standard besciamella because there's no cream milk here!\nHere\u2019s an easy-to-make recipe that anyone can pull off with minimal effort. We\u2019ll start by mixing equal parts olive and butter until it becomes runny\u2014 then add all of the ingredients except wine into a pan on medium heat while keeping everything stirring consistently so as not to burn anything down; once finished remove from hot pot and let cool before pouring slowly over your favorite food dish!\n# Chapter 7: Using Sauces in Cooking\nSauces play a huge part in all cooking and eating! Here are some tips for making the most of them:\nThis is perhaps one reason why sauces matter so much. For example, without gravy we wouldn\u2019t have anything good to eat other than plain bread (or nothing). It adds flavor AND moistness \u2013 two very essential components that must be present when enjoying any type food.\nThere can often seem like too many different kinds but all you really need is just about three: A B\u00e9chamel-based white sauce; Brown with wine or red meat juice added--and finally Hollandaise cream based sauces. Of course there's more than this if someone has some really great ideas though!\nThis might be the least common use for them but they can definitely work. While you're doing other things, these liquids are boiling away and making your food taste delicious! There\u2019s nothing better than watching something on TV or playing with friends while this happens because after all that hard work at school/studying there will need some type of reward in order not to ruin everything.\nRemember what we learned earlier about the three different types\u2014white, brown sauce (with wine), and cream based sauces. Well it applies here too so consider whether you want something light or heavy depending on time constraints etc., because that could also impact how well things cook up when using"",

Of course sometimes it\u2019s possible to combine two things like white plus red but make sure if combining any sort of combo has worked before; otherwise one type may overtake another in flavor instead.\nWhen I first became interested in cooking, sauces were the thing that really captured my attention. They made me wonder how someone can turn some simple ingredients into something so great tasting! All along it wasn\u2019t too hard either because they all had basically same few elements: butter (which is usually used), flour and then finally liquid like broth.\nIt didn't take much effort on my part at first - just following directions by adding one after next thing until mixture thickened up nicely enough without getting clumpy or lumpy. The most essential step though was waiting patience because each type has its own time requirement before becoming ready for use in actual recipes!\n# Chapter 8: Let's Try Using Sauces for Cooking\nHere are a few tasty meals to try your hand at that work well with these three sauces from chapter 6:\nA classic all-American dish, chicken and mashed potatoes can be served up with any of our delicious sauces. Use this recipe on one side while following my directions in how they interact together as part an entire meal.\nThis recipe is perfect for when you\u2019re feeling a little fancy! For starters heat some olive oil plus butter over medium-low before saut\u00e9ing mushrooms and onions until soft--about 8 mins total cooking time; season generously with salt + pepper. Next add garlic, wine & rosemary then increase temperature to high but don't stir too much otherwise things will splatter all over your stove top.\nAdd brown sauce next into veggie mixture along ground beef that's been seasoned well on both sides by combining eggs and bread together until moistened (but not soggy).\n# Chapter 9: Dessert Sauces\nA sweet, creamy fruit topping made with fresh fruits like strawberries or bananas in addition to milk plus sugar for delicious dessert sauces is one of my personal favorites. The best part? They\u2019re so easy to make at home!\nThis simple recipe will show you how quickly and easily this can be done without any special equipment - all it requires are some basic kitchen tools that most people already have on hand such as a blender (or food processor), measuring cups/spoons, bowls for mixing ingredients together. Plus there's even ways around having too much fruit in your house since we'll just be using juice from canned fruits which saves the hassle of washing them clean or drying off excess water.\nAs I"",

The secret behind this wonderful sauce is that it's simply a mixture between fruit and liquid--in other words sugar, milk plus just whatever kind (or types) of sweetener(s).\nThe only requirement here though isn\u2019t so much what specific ingredients are added in but rather how they're blended together. Some people like their toppings smooth while others prefer chunkier textures - either way both work! The reason for this being that each individual has personal preferences when it comes down to dessert sauces.\nFor those looking beyond just \u201cstrawberry milkshakes\u201d there's plenty more out there such as Banana Cream Pie Milkshake or even a Cinnamon Apple Crumble Milk Shake. But then again these are all variations on one underlying concept: blending fruit juices/sauces into delicious desserts without having any added fats/oils - which many times tend cause issues due either to personal taste preferences (think about the health benefits) or because most places don\u2019t offer alternatives.\nAnd for anyone who's curious enough after reading this blog post but doesn't necessarily know much about nutrition in general then here is a good resource site. Now that you are better informed let\u2019s get back into making our strawberry milkshakes!\nThe Best Way to Make This Recipe\nYou'll need the following ingredients from your kitchen:\n- Strawberries (about 3/4 cup chopped or half of one big container frozen berries thawed without juice if using this option).\n1 tablespoon sugar or honey\n1-2 teaspoons vanilla extract & optional extra ice cubes for blending\nHere's a list with some pointers on what NOT to do when following the steps in order.\nDon't substitute fruit juices since then it won't taste as good, especially considering how well the two flavors work together so much. But even if doing just strawberries alone - don\u2019t use anything but whole berries; chopping them beforehand is optional\nDon't add too many ice cubes because this makes your final product icy cold which isn't ideal for milkshakes that are meant to go with desserts, plus sometimes certain food doesn\u2019t taste as good after being frozen.\n# Chapter 10: What Else Can You Do With Sauces?\nHere's just some ideas about what else we can do with sauces. Don't feel like these are the ONLY things out there! There is plenty of other stuff!\nIf you want your veggies to have a different flavor, then try dipping them in sauce before you eat or cook up another meal."",

Then once that's mixed in perfectly all you need do now is put this over any kind of greens lettuce leaves spinach etc...\nWe could also add them to sandwiches! Instead just dipping into one type use two types - barbecue on first side and ketchup second; mix both together after mixing ingredients inside before putting back onto bun bottom.\nAnd speaking about adding flavor \u2013 how often have we heard people say they need something more interesting tasting than water when cooking? Or maybe it's because we didn't know what would work well with our dishes too?\nHere are some ideas from the internet:\nTomato sauce can be used to cook pasta, and many sauces call for a little bit of liquid to loosen up and bind all those yummy ingredients together. That\u2019s why spaghetti is cooked in tomato-based sauce before it hits your fork.\nThe same goes for soup! The difference between stock + veggies vs meaty stews lies not only with what's being added (more often than not), but also how long you let that mix simmer down so flavors really meld into one another.\""\nThis blog talks about adding sauce to rice! It says: \""Adding tomato-based sauces will give your steamed or fried rices a nice burst of flavor - and don't forget the spice. Whether it's a sweet chili sauce (red pepper flakes if you're making yours from scratch) mixed with some soy sauce, teriyaki glaze for a salty-sweet Asian twist.\n# Chapter 11: Let\u2019s Take This To A New Level\nNow that we have learned how sauces can be used in cooking and eating. It's time to take it up another notch by applying these newly acquired skills into our everyday meals! This part includes some tips on what dishes work well with different types of flavored liquids; as well as ideas from social media like Pinterest.\nA few words about pasta:\nIt\u2019s no secret that pasta is one of Italy\u2019s most famous and delicious exports. And if you ask me, I\u2019d say it couldn\u2019t get any better than perfectly cooked al dente rigatoni smothered in tomato sauce (and maybe some meat). The best part?

To recap they are: Tomato-based BBQ sauce, hot pepper cream sauce (or anything made from red chili paste/sauces), creamy white wine or herb based condiments such as Beurre blanc .\nWe also touched on how these things go hand in hand with different kinds of meaty goodness - whether that's simply slathered into a chicken breast until cooked through for dinner at home, grilled up over an open fire all night long during BBQ season.\nIn this chapter we'll look deeper into what kind goes well together so as to satisfy both hunger & palette. This includes more than just using one type of flavored liquid but also adding in other ingredients too that complement each others\u2019 taste profiles!\nFirst off let\u2019s talk about steak \u2013 arguably America's most classic meat dish next to chicken breast. To make some tasty BBQ sauce, first mix together equal parts ketchup (or tomato paste) plus brown sugar; add vinegar then mustard for extra kick if desired! Let this mixture simmer on low until thickened, stirring occasionally so no burning occurs from direct heat source.\nNext come up with your preferred marinade/sauce combinations - try onion + garlic as a base seasoning before adding spices like thyme leaves or rosemary sprigs. For vegetarians who want something equally good looking out but sans meat these also work perfectly well atop any seared veggies (think zucchini) alongside grilled eggplant slices & mushrooms.\nOne last thing to keep in mind, for those wanting maximum texture contrast consider using different cuts of beef - think filet steak vs ribeye since each provides their own unique qualities when paired with barbecue/balsamic-type flavored liquids."",

You could even try out new combinations by going outside your usual repertoire, which may lead up unexpected delicious discoveries!\n- Be creative with how much seasoning is added. For example if it turns out too salty then add milk or vinegar and voila ! You'll have yourself a whole new dish that tastes fantastic while cutting back dramatically on its sodium content at the same time - two birds one stone right ? And speaking of tasting\u2026.\n  - Never skip the step where you sample what is being made. This will allow any changes needed to be made based upon personal preference because everyone has their own unique set requirements when deciding if this tastes good or bad etc.; so better safe than sorry I guess ?\n- Keep a close eye on temperature\u2014especially when dealing with dairy products as high heat can cause these ingredients such as milk cream butter etc., too much acidity from leavening agents like baking soda & powder.

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Verbal aggression
2. Lack of employment
3. Racial slur","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

The story follows this as your character tries but fails because people are hungry, thirsty or dying of thirst\u2026 It is just the usual nonsense text that RPGs usually tell you upon waking up in their game but instead of telling it to me I am going through my dialogue with other characters. After I get into conversation with a couple survivors who take an interest in him he finally gets offered a job and his storyline can start.\nThe actual cutscene is really long and full of text that takes a lot out of it, also since you never actually see anything happen before or during the story your character just appears to have magically appeared where ever people think he will help them. So how do you avoid this in case you don\u2019t want The Walking Dead ruining your start by trying to push their cutscenes on you? It\u2019s simple: create a save slot with only basic items and talk to EVERYONE who offers work or doesn \u2018t offer work but is near enough that could possibly ask for help later on (if possible). Then go back through the old game log until there are no more dialogue options left and start over from here.\nWhat else can you say about a game that starts by making your character wake up after being hit with something?

That sounds like an awful way to begin any game, but this is especially odd because The Walking Dead takes place in the world of apocalypses. It would make much more sense if you were woken by hordes of zombies trying their best to eat your guts instead. I understand that they want everyone playing at least once with all characters before picking one for long-term use but shouldn\u2019t there be some sort of warning?\nThe Walking Dead tries so hard not only does it force me into watching cutscenes just like in other games, now even my character gets forced into doing stuff he never wanted to do! And when you get the option later on anyway? It\u2019s still not as good because by this time everyone knows who I am and has decided they\u2019re either going with me or against \u2013 which makes starting anywhere else useless!\nWhat about people that aren\u2019t interested in The Walking Dead universe but would enjoy a zombie survival simulator set during the dawn of the apocalypse? Well unfortunately all is lost for you, unless someone can write up an RPG Maker MV mod to change everything so it doesn\u2019t suck. Until then though I won\u2019t even be loading my old game because there\u2019s no point since I\u2019m going to have too much stuff.\nSo what about me as a player who likes starting from scratch and just wants some simple jobs when he starts, is this really such an awful thing that The Walking Dead needed to make everyone suffer through their story line before we get the pleasure of choosing our own? No matter how many times I do it, after all, there will always be someone left behind.\nIf you\u2019re going into a post-apocalyptic world and are still interested in making money then maybe start by taking up farming! And while your at it why not grow some trees with fruit on them as well; if you work hard enough to make the game interesting for everyone that\u2019s fine, but if this is forced upon players before they get to do what THEY want than I think most people will agree that \u201cThe Walking Dead: Season One isn\u2019t worth your time\u201d."",

The opening cutscene of the final chapter in the original Telltale series has Lee Everett waking up from having been knocked out and then going on foot to rescue people from their burning cars at a nearby rest stop before being met by some walkers on his way there, which is pretty much exactly what happens here but with less dialogue.\nIf you look back through your game log again this time looking for text related specifically towards survival instincts you\u2019ll find two more entries:\nYou survived the crash. You\u2019re still alive!\nAs it turns out, \u201cYour Survival Instincts Have Kicked In.\u201d Actually means something pretty simple: Your character is alive after being knocked out. That\u2019s all there really was supposed to be about this in terms of plot; Lee being hit by something and then waking up again just so he could go help save some people from dying.\nThe problem is that The Walking Dead uses too much text, and not enough of it at what might matter most: telling a story. Most games I\u2019ve played with RPG elements will do this same thing of starting out the player in what amounts to one big cutscene that explains everything they need to know so far; but after all is said and done there are still choices which players can make before taking on their first boss battle or quest if it becomes too difficult for some reason. So while Lee Everett waking up from having been hit by something might seem like a dumb idea at first, it only works because Telltale understands that this kind of thing isn\u2019t actually required to start making choices \u2013 Lee could walk right back out into town after saving those people (although I suppose he\u2019d probably be pretty shaken up).\nSo maybe The Walking Dead is using too many words in its initial cutscenes just so players will get used more easily with how little dialogue there really should be at this stage; although by the time Lee\u2019s next chapter starts he doesn\u2019t have any choices anyway since it was all scripted beforehand (meaning you know exactly what your character is going to say). All The Walking Dead is doing here then, aside from making us wonder if our characters will ever find their voices again after hearing each and every line so far\u2026\nThe point being that I\u2019m not mad because this cutscene doesn\u2019t work as well without the words like a lot of people seem to be \u2013 it\u2019s fine when you realize what they\u2019re trying tell your character instead.

The phrase itself explains that your character has been hit by *something*; whether it was actually a walker attack or not isn\u2019t the point here since they don\u2019t want us getting too attached until we meet other survivors who will help fill her backstory at some point.\n\u2013 The reason for this story beat (aside from making Lee feel like he\u2019s alive after having had to play through all those tough battles during Season One) is that it sets up why players are now playing as Clementine rather than him \u2013 which in itself works out pretty well considering how awkwardly Telltale decided not knowing who was really telling these stories got with both endings.\n\u2013 Also, the idea behind starting from scratch doesn\u2019t work so very much for survival horror games like The Walking Dead series , especially when you consider that Lee had already done a few things before deciding to go off and help those people get out of their cars at the rest stop. At least he left Clementine alone with her dog while they were gone since it\u2019s not too bad of an idea having two potential future protagonists traveling together just yet \u2013 but still.\nSo yeah, maybe some of us really will care about what that phrase means even if there isn\u2019t more text explaining exactly how important survival instincts are; we\u2019ll probably figure out soon enough why so much effort is being put into pointing it out before anyone gets too comfortable with Lee as he moves forward on his own again."",

Maybe even having Lee wake up to find his phone blown away by gunshots as a clue right then and there that something terrible happened during their journey \u2013 although I guess the same issue of being too obvious would probably happen if anything is left unexplained because someone might think this didn\u2019t have much effect on where Lee went next either.\nIf your character doesn\u2019t care about who was texting him all day long while away from them both for so many hours then there isn\u2019t really any reason why they should get into a conversation with another guy whose family thinks it\u2019s fine if anyone knows their last name now just because someone saw you together at some point in time during those days when nothing else happens besides walking around talking and seeing people do different things too. It might still be okay for certain stories without much depth or realism to work out well anyway; but don\u2019t forget about how most fans wanted one ending over the other back then due mainly because both Lee AND Clementine survived instead of just one person having made it through Season One so far by now.\nThe same goes when considering why we need to care too much at this point in time even if not everyone knows everything that happens. If your main character doesn\u2019t realize yet that something terrible happened while he was gone with them both missing for more hours than anyone would expect then there isn\u2019t really any reason why they should be so worried whenever getting into a conversation about who could\u2019ve killed their family members without leaving behind anything other than some gunshots which sound like someone being shot in the head anyway (or even multiple times over).\nIn short, it doesn\u2019t matter how important something might seem at first but then isn\u2019t very much later on once knowing what really happened if anyone cares enough about Lee surviving here or not since most players are only concerned with finding out what happens next no matter who died before seeing this one last goodbye video"",

"@katherinejean79 ""5 million year old fuck"" I just died of laughter ___ soo funny and I agree","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “@katherinejean79 ""5 million year old fuck"" I just died of laughter ___ soo funny and I agree”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Humor
2. Amusement
3. Agreement","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

I am proud to say that I have grown into an average person who does things like sleep for five or six hours straight and can be quite pleasant at times. My most recent accomplishment involves a project in which I had to get up early every morning (at 5am) and type out each of the Lord's Prayers, which is actually quite humorous because when you are asked about your schoolwork you tend to lie anyway so, yeah. On Saturday we actually did something called \""Fright Night\"" at my house where everyone who wanted to could come over for a night of fun consisting mostly just of running around in the dark scaring each other and that was pretty cool; I would have uploaded pictures but since they are all on my cell phone it is rather difficult.\nThere has been some discussion about this website. As you can see, I am currently using a \""MySpace\"" account which many people here consider to be very pathetic. Well, considering the fact that I don't go out and get into trouble (for the most part), I guess I have not really developed much of a social life so I figured what better way than this? Also it is free and doesn't take up toooo...muc....much time (yes time IS money). Since I will be starting my senior year in high school, I plan on spending more time here since you won't see me walking around the woods or anything.

You\u2019ll also want to warn people not to stand near windows unless they have protective gear on.\nThe player who hits their target has to catch them in the air with their hand without letting it drop if possible!

Once everyone has placed all the pieces in proper place (and only then), start taking turns asking \u201cWhere am I hit?\u201d\nIf your opponent says yes then you go again otherwise say no to continue playing till someone guesses correctly where another ship is located at which point he/she wins and gets bonus points from sinking boats.\nAnother way for some fun without using dice? A game of dominoes. But instead, get your friends or family members together who are willing enough into taking on this challenge that can be solved by either memory skill alone!\nAll you need to do is pick out any tiles left over after everyone has found their match pairs from other parts in front-of-your-body-side-wards so there will always something worth playing with even when nothing else shows up. In case anyone doesn't know what these look like we'll show them how simple it really is just one side faces each other at either end, and then another half matches right beside where those pieces are stacked against themselves in their hands waiting for someone lucky enough.\""\nDominoes can be a fun game that requires strategy because you have to place your domino correctly.\nIf someone places an incorrect tile next door though there's no way out of losing if he doesn't know how many more tiles they need until his opponent reveals them!\nThe first player with all seven double-sided dominos wins this round but also keeps on going till everyone has had some turn which means another win goes into that person or team while someone else plays again since we'll probably see at least one match pair somewhere else within their hand whenever its there"",

This means more chances to meet new faces while playing games that will last longer than just one day.\nYou could use a deck of cards and create rules based on the suits for each game you play. For example: \""Hearts,\"" where players take turns drawing from their own hands with no set goal in sight; Clubs, which involve taking turns until one person runs out first- winning him/ her whatever prize they've been allotted at random prior; Spades (pairs), Diamonds - solo player wins if his hand beats opponents'. Whatever way works best depending upon how many join! And don't forget there's always something fun when paired with an accompanying song or two.\nThe key is to have rules, that keep people from going on and doing their own thing during the game. If someone does stray off from what they're supposed be focusing then give them back in line so everyone can return focus onto winning together as a team!\nYou'll want something simple enough where children who haven\u2019t played before won't take too long learning how everything works-- but still gives more experienced players something engagingly challenging without putting any stress levels through the roof either way."",

However instead to keep things interesting make sure there are no ties because if someone ever gets stuck trying hard with little success chances are they'll feel discouraged-- which has nothing but negative consequences on morale overall!\u00a0\nThe trick here's making it as easy or difficult depending upon what works best between groups participating together for maximum enjoyment without anyone getting frustrated after awhile (unless that person truly does belong in time-out).

And if you have a projector available and big space then perhaps try out \""hide n seek\""? It's not too difficult to set up; just make sure there aren't any windows in each room before everyone hides away from view.\nI would be remiss, however without adding my own suggestions! Here I go:\nPlay Hide And Seek - This is an obvious one but a classic that all kids will love. If you can find some hiding spots (either indoors or outside), this game never gets old and there's always opportunity for creativity with how people choose their hideouts.\nSplat Attack - Another classic from back-the-day when we weren't so worried about being too violent while playing tag; Splat attack is all about who can last longest holding onto two balloons filled with water (or another substance). There was usually at least one big squirt gun used to get the last person out before someone became \""it.\"" This still works great even I have never seen anyone use it for more than ten seconds though! If your kids aren't that interested in running around then you could try making a game which involves hitting targets on each other's balloons without breaking them but with water rather than air inside.\nCapture The Flag - Capture the flag is another awesome game that works well no matter who participates and what level of experience they have. You just need to divide into groups, appoint someone as \""it,\"" designate their location (and possibly also one for where all captured items will be dropped off). Then see how many times people can run from the other side without getting caught!\nLaser Tag - Another team building game that involves running around with equipment (this time it's high-tech ones) but there are some things about Laser tag which may not work so well if you want everyone to have fun. It\u2019s difficult for kids under seven years old due them being short and also because most laser gun toys out on the market won't shoot far from where they're held.\nYou can play basketball with a group of people who all know how to do it, or try something new"",

If things seem dull just add another rule where players have thirty seconds after being tagged to make it out of bounds again (and if someone gets captured three times in a row then he/she has been eliminated).\nThe rules for this game could get complicated and interesting depending on how many people play. For example, one group might be trying their hardest not losing any members while another is strategizing which player they have more success at getting tagged by using the freeze.\nThere are all kinds of ways to play so just come up with some ideas in advance before inviting friends over!\nIt doesn't matter if you're planning for a game night, date night or get-together - there's always something fun that everyone can take part! A little creativity goes along way when looking on the internet for games with no special equipment (or at least not too many).

This requires some planning but doesn't need any equipment which may make it easier depending on how much space you\u2019ve got.\nDon\u2019t forget about music too; It can help create an atmosphere conducive for everyone getting along well together! Here are a few ideas: Make up dance moves to go with the song as best they know how if no one objects and plays some fun games after each song like tag or hide n seek. Don't mind us we'll just be over here enjoying ourselves until dinner!\nYou could have something funny written on there that everyone will love, or maybe an inside joke between two friends. What matters most is who's behind it because nobody likes strangers sending them unwanted gifts unless they've been specifically requested.\nThe point of the gift should make someone smile and think about him/herself positively - what has happened recently in his life? Perhaps he did something nice yesterday for another person but it was overlooked by everyone around?\nIt doesn't matter how big, small or expensive"",

U needa delete ths shit,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “U needa delete ths shit”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Delete request
3. Profanity","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

They are truly terrible and have no right to say anything or even be alive.\nDo you find yourself asking, \""Is there anyone else in the world as miserable as me?\"" Well, keep this link close by because if they don't read this then maybe someone else will be so lost from sadness their tears will never dry up... Until a new article pops on the screen that is. This website's articles are more of a nuisance than an entertainment source.\nNow you feel like your heart has been ripped out and thrown into the ocean, right? You may feel hopeless but fear not, there is someone who can help. That website with all the terrible articles will no longer torment you or anyone.

In fact I think my only encounter in regards with the internet was when my grandmother died last month after being infected by malware that got onto her router through an unprotected WiFi network she shared at home.\nShe had a very difficult life even before then but especially now because without those regular family get-togethers for dinners every Sunday afternoon it's just not as enjoyable anymore - everyone misses them dearly including myself who wasn't exactly close to my grandmother either way (though I still wish things could have worked out better). But sadly there isn\u2019t much more that can be done other than hope people will realize how important family is before something bad happens like this again.\nAnyway long story short I doubt anything good ever comes from sitting in front of some screen all day scrolling through random websites looking up useless information anyways. The real world has so many problems we could potentially solve if everyone started spending more time actually going out there and doing something instead - whether it\u2019s helping others, learning about different cultures, or just connecting face-to-face with friends/family members who haven't spoken\nSo yeah don't take this as me being rude but honestly why should I?

Leave my best friends alone . Jeez ! @lexi_volleyball_2”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Lexi
2. Best friend
3. Anger","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Yet somehow with religion the situation is very different, as has been brought up in our previous conversation regarding your Facebook group (and indeed many others I've had there). That's why I like philosophy, you can discuss these concepts without getting anyone into a frenzy.\nI don't really mind arguing for something so long as it brings people closer together and helps them to understand one another. If truth is subjective then we need to take some of us along with the other, if this causes some problems, then let's look at how we can solve those problems. I see no problem with that.\nWhy would you feel bad watching me engage in what you called \""something unfruitful\""? Is it not possible for something less than fruitful by your subjective standards to produce fruit? Also do things have any meaning in themselves if they rely upon a subject's point of view?\nIn short, is there nothing to this other than the fact that I'm wasting my time?

This is dogmatic, which goes against what you've claimed before on other topics, where it seems like you're more accepting of alternative explanations that challenge your own beliefs, even going so far as to change yours.\nYou also state: \""If truth is subjective then we need to take some of us along with the other\"". That means you have a choice in what beliefs someone else has and you can choose them (not force them) because it's for their 'benefit'?\nWhat if someones belief doesn't harm anyone? Are they going against your dogmatic rules now, whether or not this is true to yourself based on how much faith/belief/conviction in those beliefs a person has.\n2. There would have to be other Gods but of inferior status to The One True God, which is an absurd assumption: why should there only by one god? And I might as well ask if you believe that one of them is the Christian or Jewisn one since most people on this planet don't accept your beliefs and it's impossible for two groups who disagree on so many fundamentals to worship the same God.\n3. Why assume that what is happening in consciousness must necessarily be caused by something else existing outside/independently of it when we have no scientific nor philosophical evidence of this? This goes back into your assumption about a soul existing before and after life, which you haven't explained beyond speculation.\nLet's apply some reason:\nConsciousness is defined as an abstract thought process of sentiment or subjectivity that occurs within the physical brain (or more precisely the cerebral cortex).\nAll known conscious states depend entirely on the electro-chemical activity in the brain. (And if we go down to a subatomic level, it even depends upon quantum effects!)\nWhat does 'depends' mean and why should I assume there is anything else 'beyond' what consciousness can explain based purely on observation?\nTo give an analogy: we might say that sound requires hearing apparatus otherwise sound wouldn't be perceived.

And that's assuming everything has a 'soul' - even the inanimate like rocks and planets.\n4. If we are talking about some kind of entity existing outside conscious awareness then why do they need to think too? Can a god create something so much better than him/herself?\nWhy shouldn't there be other Gods, all being infinite with no beginning or end in terms of time, space or consciousness, creating our universe?\nWhat does it even mean for two gods to 'create the same reality'? There has never been an example or definition given anywhere that allows us to answer these questions at more than a subjective level.\nHow can you know who is right if there are no objective facts about any of this? Do your faith/beliefs/truth feelings count when so many billions disagree with yours?\nWe've all seen the stories in Christian bibles where God has his children fight eachother over such nonsense as land or women, and it's hard to see that happening if you accept they are just different manifestations of The One True Consciousness.\nIt seems like dogma is more important when one considers your attitude towards someone else's beliefs. Do you want me to believe what you do, even though I can't know whether any 'god' exists? Why should my subjective feelings about a hypothetical entity based on faith (ie. believing some statement which doesn't have evidence) count for anything compared with yours?\nThis is why we need facts not dogma: because two people can agree that X + Y = Z but if you're talking religion then even this much isn't always true and it's quite subjective too.\nIf all your philosophy amounts to 'feelings' in the heart/breast region, such that any claim about anything can be defined as a belief or non-belief based on nothing more than faith in something unknown which may not exist outside one's imagination, then why should anyone else"",

You've stated that this is acceptable in cases such as a person being proven wrong about some fact they thought was true, so please be consistent by applying it to your own philosophy.\nI mean what else are you left with if not the subjective feelings of 'knowing' things which may or may not have correspondence within physical reality (the same way that someone believing in unicorns has no evidence other than their faith based on nothing more objective)? You can't deny that a subjective statement is only real to oneself.\nSo I guess we'll just have two sets of subjective beliefs until one of us gets lucky and the idea really exists objectively. The probability for this happening are roughly 50:50, but if you assume there's 'truth' on your side then why haven't any others agreed with you? Especially as they were all part of the same culture since no-one was cut off from all external influences while growing up?\nI do believe that a creator exists - in this case, it is not the God I know Christians often discuss. It would be better if we didn\u2019t use religious language because people automatically go to thoughts and feelings they have as children raised within their family\u2019s faith traditions.\nThis does influence how one then conceives what some might call \u2018divine\u2019, or a metaphysical reality that exists outside physical things.\nThe argument is not meant for an atheist, however. They reject such thought altogether, including my view of it; so I am actually trying to explain the idea for Christians who agree with me about God and creation but are unsure of how these words relate to other experiences in life, or what\u2019s going on when they have a spiritual encounter.\nThe main point of this post was to show that when we define \u2018eternal\u2019 as something that is without beginning or end then it makes no sense for an eternal entity (i think of pure awareness) to create time. However if I assume there had been another creator before God, why should anyone listen? That\u2019s like saying two people could be in the universe at once and both of them can create physical things which appear to share space within that same realm\u2026.\nAlso it becomes an infinite regress since the question would apply just as much for this pre-God entity who was eternal.

I do not think all Christians would agree with me here \u2013 if they did then why isn\u2019t everyone arguing this way?\nThe reason most likely is because of what we\u2019ve talked about already: the subjective element that comes from faith/conviction in something which cannot be proven.\nWe should discuss these things on a more level playing field, however; not one where you automatically reject anything I might say based on presuppositions about God being real. If there are no objective facts then why shouldn\u2019t we all just talk without such baggage imposed upon our language?\nIf someone feels that they have had an experience of knowing something with certainty for themselves \u2013 eg through mystical revelation, direct contact with spirits via mediumship, meditation or any other form of intuitive insight where they do not think their senses are playing tricks on them. I cannot deny this subjective knowledge as real even if there was no external stimulus causing it; since this is how all knowledge begins from scratch without prior reference point.\nI know that many people will agree with what I\u2019ve said here, but some won\u2019t, just like others disagree about other things which they don\u2019t have a personal connection to and must base their opinions solely on objective evidence available to everyone. Theists can be divided into two groups: those who only use reason and observation of the world in this way (the agnostics), or those who also take subjective feelings such as \u2018knowing\u2019 something true without having any external knowledge about it at all.\nThe latter will find my ideas interesting but ultimately unconvincing based on their personal experiences with God. For them, there is more to life than what can be seen with eyes alone. They believe in things unseen: namely an eternal soul or spirit that survives death of the body and exists elsewhere outside this world \u2013 wherever \u2018heaven\u2019 might be if such a place does exist after we die.\nWhen I talk about creation out of nothing it has both spiritual and material dimensions; since even though God creates all matter (which must exist in space/time), there is also something non-physical or supernatural at work here too\u2026"",

We simply can\u2019t know about it directly through reason alone but instead rely on faith because our minds cannot grasp these things without help from another source which goes beyond what we already believe to be true right now.\nI think this is why so many people find religion appealing in some way or other despite never having actually read any of the holy scriptures themselves, nor even cared about such issues before they met someone who believed differently than them \u2013 just like how all humans have different personalities. If everyone was exactly the same then life would be very dull indeed since we\u2019d lack variety.\nSo there are two kinds of people in this regard: those who accept my premise that God is nonphysical being without beginning or end in time/space, vs those who reject it because they cannot explain things like near-death experiences (where patients come back claiming having seen loved ones who died before them) using naturalistic explanations; despite many attempts to do so by scientists these claims remain unproven today and will likely never be proven unless someone invents a camera that can record what happens outside the body once it ceases functioning completely.\nUntil then I suggest trying meditation or exploring other dimensions of consciousness through altered states brought about intentionally via drugs like LSD.

This should lead us down the road of further exploration in order to gain a proper understanding of these concepts that many have yet to realize as being true. For example, it is commonly taught by philosophers throughout time (ie. Plato) that there are two types of wisdom: one which comes from knowledge about an external subject, and another which comes purely through reason.\nAs such I would like us both to examine what we know personally so far regarding God \u2013 before reaching out together into deeper territory where others may have ventured already. There are many things which cannot be proven yet because scientific methods fall short due to inherent limitations in how they work\u2026\nYet they also give certain reliable knowledge for the realm of physical reality, and allow us to draw conclusions from evidence which should not contradict those made by other people using similar means \u2013 provided we consider all angles before making decisions based on personal bias.\nThere is always a subjective element involved however; since human beings have different viewpoints depending where and when they were born into this world (amongst many factors). What I mean here is that culture plays an important role in shaping our minds through language and social interaction. We each develop preferences for various things which may seem arbitrary to someone else.\nThis does not necessarily make either one of us right or wrong so long as we do not harm others with violent behaviour. In other words, subjective opinions about anything are fine \u2013 until they start affecting me negatively in some way\u2026and then I might choose confrontation instead!\nFor instance: if you believe that \u2018women should always obey their husbands\u2019 even though it goes against my values and principles for people to be treated like possessions or inferior beings just because of gender. If so\u2026then sorry but this kind of thing is not okay \u2013 especially not these days when women\u2019s rights are getting equal recognition alongside men all across countries worldwide.\nI do hope I am making more sense now! Thankyou once again\nIn order to gain clarity about the concept 'eternal creator', it will be important for us both (and anyone reading this series) to understand some other basic ideas before venturing further into these topics. For instance: what is \""creation\"", who or what is God, and how were physical things created from nothingness?\nThere are two main schools of thought when considering the question:\nSome philosophers believe that everything was formed by an eternal mind or god who used His imagination to construct all life out there like a video game; while others do not.

The third category includes people who accept some kind of creator but don't go so far as believing that He was eternal - perhaps because they feel there has never existed anything without beginning or ending. (Although I might dispute the validity of this claim).\nIt is best therefore to take an agnostic stance: acknowledging both sides and not deciding prematurely until we have examined all relevant evidence carefully ourselves, which includes examining what others say about these issues too.\nThere are many reasons why someone could choose one option over another; for instance some may simply lack access information needed in order decide either way. They haven't looked at every piece of evidence yet because they don't know how/where to find everything relevant before reaching their conclusions.\nOthers might be swayed by personal preference - perhaps if they have had spiritual experiences which seem impossible without assuming something beyond material existence exists outside humans minds\u2026and then this leads them down a path towards embracing faith instead. Some people are just naturally skeptical so will reject all types of 'spiritual' explanations until they see evidence that can't be explained any other way.\nThe key point here is that everyone should consider ALL viewpoints objectively without bias before forming opinions based on what seems reasonable/makes sense to them personally, and this means taking into account multiple perspectives from different points along\n1) You imply I don\u2019t believe in the scientific method.

We\u2019ve agreed this applies when we are dealing with material things which cannot be proven to exist: but then again none of us have ever seen a soul, so how could anyone know for sure one way or another?

There haven't been very many examples of someone actually coming back from physical death with memories intact enough to discuss later so far....but it still happens often enough for us at least speculate about whether some form of eternal life exists after all.\nThe thing is however that most people today don\u2019t believe in souls because they simply couldn\u2019t do without science; and if there was no way we could ever prove otherwise then eventually everyone would stop caring even though nothing has changed since Jesus died.
