Your gun grab is unpatriotic  fucking muslim ,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “ @potus fuck u &amp; ur unamerican ASS!!! You suck!! Your gun grab is unpatriotic  fucking muslim ”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","Here are three relevant and distinct keywords for the provided text:

1. Personal attack
2. Gun grab
3. Anti-Muslim sentiment","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

I\u2019ve met hundreds of U.S. residents; several times as many are anti-gun as pro-gun.\nThat being said, the average American gun owner does own and use their handguns to protect themselves if need be (hence why they keep them in their vehicles).\nYour views about guns is based on your personal experiences and what you have heard from people who also lack actual knowledge of how the United States truly operates. If you really want to get an idea about this issue, instead of looking at biased documentaries such as Bowling For Columbine (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203290/), check out sites run by people who actually own guns and are involved in gun safety classes.\nA good place to start is with the NRA. http://www.nra.org/\nThat should give you a little different perspective on this topic than just your personal experiences growing up abroad, or what you heard from others.\nJust some food for thought\u2026 Happy holidays!\nThank-you.

According to secret intelligence reports compiled by Operation Sparrowhawk between March 2008 and December 2011, there is now an unprecedented amount of corrupt dealings among all levels of Victoria Police. The Herald Sun understands Victoria remains a national hotspot for criminal gang activity which has also infiltrated ranks in NSW police.\nhttp://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/organized-crime-infiltrates-law-enforcement-ranks-with-criminals-selling-drugs-on-the-street-source/story-fni0fit3-1226797972577\nI\u2019m sure gun control advocates here in Australia would be more than a bit miffed at your suggestion that they have \u2018no end in sight\u2019 to their battle against violent crime as we are now experiencing record low levels (at least in relation to the numbers of guns available and our population).\nThere is also some suggestion that your claim about how \u2018guns account for roughly 1/3rd of Canadian crimes\u2019 isn\u2019t actually true either as this appears largely based on misrepresentation of Canada\u2019s homicide rate (which it has never exceeded 2.6 homicides per 100,000 people) in order to inflate the proportion of gun-related deaths.\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2289507/We-cant-stop-gunman-America-stopping-viagra-Victoria-Attwood.html\nI am not a statistician so I will leave it up to you and others to debate my numbers \u2013 in fact, one of the studies I reviewed shows gun-related crime increased (which could be from illegally imported handguns):\nAs for Australia gun control advocates that claim your battle has \u2018no end\u2019, they are only repeating what was said at least 11 years ago; and based on their own experiences so far with record levels of organized crime in that country, they\u2019ll likely think otherwise now.

For example:\nIn Australia however, there hasn\u2019t been any kind of comparison made between those states with higher levels of gun ownership and those that have low numbers.\nTherefore, your table is incomplete at best since we don\u2019t know how many people are involved in all these nations\u2019 homicides from every source (including hand-to-hand combat) \u2013 which isn\u2019t usually reported since it\u2019s hard to prove unless someone survives so please feel free to make corrections. Thanks!\nI\u2019d like to note that France has a relatively low homicide rate compared with other countries and this is despite the fact they have had their gun laws tightened over time. The same applies for Austria, Sweden (after banning handguns) etc.. These sorts of figures seem to indicate that access to firearms doesn\u2019t really impact on overall levels of homicides.\nI\u2019ll give you an example here in Australia where many people own guns but the rate is still much lower than the USA despite this: A US citizen may carry a gun onto his or her property, whereas someone who lives next door with similar socioeconomic characteristics and motivations for owning firearms might not be able to legally own one. Hence why they will use knives etc.. instead if there\u2019s no other option.\nOn that note though \u2013 I don\u2019t see this table being all that useful since it doesn\u2019t provide any statistical information about these homicides. Instead we just get some quotes which are likely cherry-picked from those with an axe to grind (if you know what I mean).\nCan you cite sources for anything written in Australian publications before 2008? Thank-you!\nThe following source lists homicides by gun and knife among other methods, but it\u2019s not all that useful since there is no way of knowing how many people were involved in those incidents.\n\u2013http://www.scribd.com/doc/15060375/Gun-Violence-Statistics\nA more recent example can be found here: http://srobertsonblog.blogspot.co.uk/search?q=homicides+gun+knife This lists homicides involving knives from 1999 till today. There were approximately 4,000 knife-related deaths over this period of time (source is unclear though).\nSo based on all the evidence you\u2019ve provided so-far and by reading through other sources as well\u2026I think I can say with some degree of confidence that it\u2019s true Canadians have been disarmed at best and gun owners are just criminals"",

So including these would skew things a little bit.\nNow as for your comment that \u201cThe table does include Switzerland though, which is a pretty good example considering how well armed they are and why it\u2019s difficult for someone who wants gun control to say something as definitive about homicide rates due in part to access.\u201d I can see where you\u2019re going with this but I\u2019d like point out one thing that may change things just slightly.\nThat being: Switzerland has compulsory service, which means all of those guns will be in storage not readily available on an ongoing basis unless someone chooses to carry theirs everywhere. So by your standards a country like France isn\u2019t as bad since they have far more people with access to firearms etc.. The same goes for most countries even if the figures are low overall (see Sweden/Austria vs Germany/Canada).\nOn that note though, I think there is some truth in what you said about how it\u2019s difficult because all these tables tend to lump everything together without taking into account things like socio-economic factors which can make a big difference too. However since this thread hasn\u2019t really explored those issues much yet (and doesn\u2019t seem likely either) so now isn\u2019t the time to get into that right?\nI believe you said it best here about Canada\u2019s gun laws:\n\u201cThis certainly indicates Canada has been disarmed at least.\u201d\nSo unless there is evidence presented by someone more knowledgeable than us all which shows how many guns are actually used in this nation then I assume we should take your words as final on the matter. \ud83d\ude09\nThank-you for the feedback!\nAs to whether or not it\u2019s true Canadians have been \u2018disarmed\u2019 since their 2008 gun bans \u2013 this comes down to a simple question of numbers: How many firearms do people own? If they\u2019ve got millions then no real effect will occur, but if they were down around hundreds/thousands etc. things could change quite quickly depending on the situation.\nI\u2019d argue that Canadian authorities would like their citizens disarmed as much as possible because it\u2019ll help ensure compliance with whatever regulations are imposed upon them by law (which include things such as mandatory minimum sentences and firearms registration laws which have been discussed here before).\nHowever since we don\u2019t know how many guns this nation has, I think the best thing anyone can do is to assume they\u2019ve had their gun rights taken away"",

For a start it\u2019s compulsory military service and most people who own guns keep them stored somewhere \u2013 so there isn\u2019t all that much in terms of actual access even when compared directly with France etc.. So comparing Switzerland with something like Germany or Canada where everyone has unrestricted possession (unless otherwise specified) is meaningless unless you want to make some strange assumptions about things.\nThe only issue I can see being raised here as regards Swiss firearm ownership is whether its compulsory nature makes it more difficult than other nations because many people who would carry guns regularly aren\u2019t able to. As far as I know though there hasn\u2019t been any evidence presented which goes into any depth at all, so we don\u2019t have anything to go by in this case.\nAs for your comments about how Canada\u2019s laws can be viewed as an attempt to take away gun rights \u2013 again since it would depend on the number of firearms they own we\u2019re left saying \u201cit could happen\u201d rather than providing statistical evidence either way.\nOn that note however, I think any discussion which goes into detail about this will lead us all astray from the original topic so I\u2019d suggest keeping things on track from now onwards unless someone makes an effort to get involved again with some concrete facts? \ud83d\ude09\nI did say it\u2019s \u201cdifficult\u201d because there hasn\u2019t been a large enough sample size collected over time for us to make accurate observations based solely upon this one factor alone (gun ownership/access). It is only after we also take into account things such as socio-economic factors etc. that we might gain some more definite answers in regards to how these types of variables impact overall homicide rates.\nI think you forgot what I said earlier though and misinterpreted it because your last response wasn\u2019t intended to show how much gun ownership matters \u2013 instead it was just an attempt at pointing out inconsistencies or flaws found within the current table being used. This is something that has already been addressed with regard to Switzerland, so any further attempts along these lines will probably be futile unless someone posts new information which is relevant/important enough for us all to look into more deeply.\nSo once again I ask: Is there anything out there regarding this topic besides the limited amount of knowledge we\u2019ve accumulated thus far? It shouldn\u2019t take much time from anyone involved since firearms ownership issues aren\u2019t exactly complicated \u2013 even if they don\u2019t understand gun culture that well themselves\u2026"",

Still even with these potential issues etc. we only need numbers that can give us an accurate indication of how many are owned by average citizens \u2013 not professional gun handlers or those who\u2019ve been involved in some kind of incident where a firearm was present.\nAs for your response about how access to guns doesn\u2019t matter because Swiss people keep their weapons stored away somewhere I\u2019d point out it makes no difference so long as they have access and can easily obtain possession (as has largely been the case up until now). The same goes with gun laws being loosened again since all those who had them before would be able to start carrying again if any new law didn\u2019t require special considerations which were only made for certain groups etc..\nSo in this regard, Switzerland does provide something we can go by (or at least it did up until a few years ago). As long as people are armed there will always be the potential for problems. If these things occur frequently enough then those who study such events could end up finding patterns which help make sense of what\u2019s going on much more accurately.\nOn that note though, I still think we need some form of statistical evidence since it isn\u2019t necessarily accurate to simply look at an individual case or so \u2013 especially when each nation has its own unique social circumstances etc. We\u2019ve already seen plenty of examples where people try and use personal experiences as the basis for making sweeping generalisations about something without taking into account all kinds of potential differences in various areas.\nSo unless someone can provide us with some form of hard data such posts won\u2019t be very helpful towards achieving our objective so perhaps you could think up a way to get more information instead? \ud83d\ude09\nHere are three sources I\u2019ve found (which seem pretty good since they do come from Canadian publications):\n\u2013http://www.walmart.ca/ip/The-Gun-Control-Dilemma/1100003 This is one of Canada\u2019s largest gun retailers and has been operating for quite some time without any major problems.

So whether they pass laws which prevent people from owning guns without special permission and so on isn\u2019t important if nobody decides to take advantage of them anyway.\nIf this is going off track then perhaps its better off left alone right now? After all we haven\u2019t really made much progress in finding any answers that we can agree on\u2026\nI was under the impression gun restrictions were lifted (and subsequently loosened further) but I wasn\u2019t aware Switzerland had been taken off since they don\u2019t keep detailed statistics regarding firearm ownership unlike many others.\nHowever it does remain difficult to prove how many guns there are without being involved in some kind of investigation, especially when most people tend not to voluntarily disclose such private information.

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Anti-Semitism
2. Cancer diagnosis
3. Jews","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

I wish there was something that we could do to help.\nThanks for tweeting this story, it is an awesome piece. Very touching and so real because not everybody would get this chance.\nI think as people are getting old they tend to become more emotional too and more sensitive about other things in life than the young generations who mostly don't care about such issues because they know their parents will always be by their side till they die.\nAs a cancer patient I feel you. But what is so nice with technology today that can connect us to anybody around the globe or anyone at home. I am sure your daughter is feeling as special knowing she had made a moment in this life even without expecting and for me I would try everything within my limits if it was on my family member but there are some situations you just have to wait like when people don't share their cancer with others maybe because they have been reading about the treatment of chemotherapy which is known as \""Chemotherapy\"" It will kill anyone who has blood in his veins and arteries. As a patient I would tell any one not to get into this kind of drugs but it seems that these days there are lots of information provided to patient so if you find your cancer hasn't reached level 3 or higher I won't suggest you to go for treatment because we all have heard someone who has been cured of cancer then he/she gets a second attack and this time the doctor tells them \""We couldn't do anything\"".\nI think there are other natural treatments they used in old times which were far more effective than those we use today. My grandfather and his brother got into an accident when I was 9 so I went over to where they were in the hospital it has been like a week since the treatment begin but their wounds still haven't healed yet even though they have been taking several drugs by that time the one died because his body couldn't take anymore.\nI remember we used to eat lots of different foods and today everybody eats only burgers with fries or something. You should try eating some raw food it could help a lot I think because this way your stomach will be cleansed from all these chemicals which our generation is getting exposed to on daily basis. The world of nutrition in my opinion has been completely destroyed by the greediness of money who wants more than 5 times the cost for a bag full of pills with nothing but chemicals inside.\nI wish I could go back and change this time that will lead me into today so i could have"",

All we want is to live longer, happy life and feel good about ourselves but what our lives are turning out now? We all have heard so many stories from cancer patients who died soon or a year later after they were diagnosed with this disease even though doctors said it was just normal.\nThank you for sharing your experience. I had the same exact feeling as you when my grandmother passed away due to old age, she lived long enough which made me glad that someone like her in other countries doesn't get any chances of living more than 30 years but here she's been so lucky and now that is over... what can we do for them? Can we tell doctors not make their patients go through this process if there are some drugs available to cure cancer right away without all those things they say?\nI am sending you my best wishes with lots of hope.\nThat really makes me cry. My daughter who was born in 1996 is also a caregiver and I can't imagine the feeling when someone gets their first baby it's an amazing experience then we don't know what would be coming for both if only they could share everything about them since babies love telling secrets between each other this kind of thing isn't possible until you see how happy they are.\nIt really makes me mad because there should have been something doctors could do with just pills or whatever but no it's always like let's go take chemotherapy drugs!\nWhat I want to tell people is that even when your mom passes away because she couldn't make it into today don't ever get sad for living longer than 30 without anyone taking care of themselves anymore. In countries where doctors aren't using those new technology all kinds of stuff we have around here, they'll live long enough even if their families were gone which is very different from what you're going through now but there are some good news.\nI can say I'm glad because my mom passed away so easily by just talking about anything related to us and me. If only this was possible then your family wouldn't go through such hard time like what we did last month when she got sick and had an accident which broke her leg.\nHow many different reasons do people look for in their lives?\nHow can i get rid of depression so that my life"",

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Music industry criticism
2. Abusive language
3. Twitter post","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

I am happy about the increase of white female rappers such as Megan Thee Stallion who is also half-Korean-American. But I agree that Nicki Minaj should be in more rap nomination categories but she still gets recognized at all shows and awards shows. In hip-hop it's hard for rappers to get noticed due to there being so many new artists now with the growing music industry, as well as other factors such as racism. For example, Eminem was nominated 15 times this year for his album 'Music To Be Murdered By' when in reality it wasn't that great and he is still included into hip-hop because of past success.\nIn conclusion, I am generally more positive about the Grammy Awards this time due to there just being more rappers getting recognized than before. However if you compare this year's rapping nominees with past years we will see a shift in demographics from all black or mixed rap artists to now including white females and maybe even males in future nominations.\nDo you think that hip-hop culture is becoming an interracial/intercultural space?"",

4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

They've lived there for too long without forming a country - they just don't care about having their own home like a normal human being would. But hey, if you want to keep believing that they'll never stop until someone makes it happen then by all means - I'm sure they won't hate you as much.\nPalestinians were forced out in 1948 and have been trying for a sovereign state since the UN Partition Plan of November 29th, 1947. There was no reason that this could not have taken place except for actions taken to prevent it by the Zionist forces who had received clear notice from world powers on how to peacefully share their land with the Palestinians - but instead chose to drive everyone else out. This is well documented and easy enough to find a link or two online, so I won't supply one here. Look it up if you are interested.\nIf what you claim was actually possible in 1948 then why would anyone expect that things somehow became worse? Things have only gone downhill since - look at Gaza now by all means. This has nothing to do with a lack of trying though, the Israelis don't want peace because they control everything around them - there is no room for two states if Israel wants to expand and use up the West Bank.\nPalestinians were forced out in 1948 and have been trying for a sovereign state since the UN Partition Plan of November 29th, 1947\nWhy wasn't that plan agreed with by both sides? No one was 'forced' to do anything - they just didn't think it was right. And Palestinians weren't forced into being refugees - it's more like Israeli's had been made refugees too so people were moving in multiple directions all at once, and that included people from other parts of the mid-east who took this opportunity to move somewhere else without permission or explanation.\nA 'sovereign state' has a lot more requirements than just land - you can't make it happen by taking some maps offline. The world powers already knew how things would play out before 1948, but they wanted to keep their peace as much as possible so people left it be and hoped for the best.\nI didn't say anything about Jews not having lived there for a thousand years - I only said that 'no"",

They may have been on land their families held long ago, but no person was ever removed from their home or state (as much as there are disagreements over the past) so this cannot be compared to people in 1948 who were kicked out and forced onto other's lands with nothing nearby.\nEven most Jews left because they didn't agree with what was going on there, but instead all lived elsewhere - this is normal. The problem was that Israel couldn't leave well enough alone once the UN vote came about (and some people even believe it should be revisited) so things started to escalate from then onwards and things got out of hand.\nThings have only gone downhill since - look at Gaza now by all means\nNow I'm supposed to agree with you based on something that happened after 1948? The point is, if your argument is about how Palestinians are simply trying for statehood then you're arguing in favor against them not being refugees when they were driven out of their homes. You can't say it isn't happening because 'things got worse' later - they always would have been worse had the plans gone into place as expected anyway (which would still have allowed Gaza to exist)\nThey just didn't agree with how things were going and wanted them changed - there never was a reason for violence if they truly thought about that part of it, because nothing good happens from shooting people you're supposed share land with. Even the Jewish refugees had left so why keep killing each other? There's no actual solution to this problem aside from leaving it alone entirely I'm afraid.\nThe 'peace and stability plan' has failed since 1948 but what Israel really wants can't be achieved by peaceful means - they only pretend they want peace while using it as an excuse to slowly take over land. The more Arabs die the less of them left for their homes, and that's exactly how this is going (with some help from corrupt Palestinian leaders on both sides). If you look at history in retrospect then even things like 9/11 will still be blamed because the attacks were seen as unjust - which also makes them a failure no matter what happens next.\nIt isn't that hard to understand though, all anyone has to do is keep looking and see what's actually going on (whether they agree or not)\nI don\u2019t know about any Palestinian sympathizing forum.

It\u2019s not like we have a state or any other power so why would you care what I think? Do me a favor and stop calling everyone who speaks up about Israel \u201canti-Semitic\u201d! That shit is getting really old now.\nYou know there aren't \""two sides\"" of every story, right?\nJust ask yourself this: Why don\u2019t the world powers care or worry more when it comes to Palestine than they do with other countries around them being attacked? Why do you think that is? What should we make out of all this if not Palestinians just trying for self sovereign statehood (as well as their land from which no one has since 1948, including themselves)?\nAnd before I forget, there's actually a third side to the story. The truth can be found somewhere in between where both sides are on these issues - it isn't a matter of choosing one or another and this goes beyond just what Israel does vs. Palestinians being attacked.\nBut we already knew that too didn't we? We know full well by now there is no point for any more than two groups competing over the same land because it can only result in violence between them if they don\u2019t move apart from each other, which is exactly how this has been panning out since 1948. And we see how that has worked so far...not very well indeed.\nWhat's there left to say about all of this except for \""just leave them alone already\""?\nThe truth can be found in the actions taken by both parties involved - Israel should've never acted the way it did from the beginning because nothing good ever comes out of attacking unarmed locals on their own land after giving notice that something would happen there (in 1948).\nThere was always going to be a third side but this one is not like an outside mediator between two warring parties, and certainly isn't impartial as I understand most are.

If anything the truth will only become clearer with time...sooner or later everything should make sense so long as no one rushes through things without first taking their blinders off.\nThey've been left alone since 1948, and have tried but still failed - it's hard not to see why they might eventually give up if this keeps going on like it does. Maybe people just won't care anymore after a while regardless of what they do, or maybe the rest of us will be too scared by then?\nA third party solution could help ease tensions between both sides in some areas where local governments are unable to make an agreement alone but that's all - any further efforts would be wasted time at this point because everything has been tried over again so many times now and nothing else can happen after one generation of failure on top another (not without more violence). It seems like a losing battle when there is such stubbornness behind it all, not just from Israel but also Hamas which refuses to acknowledge any outside help unless someone pays them for their cooperation.\nYou seem pretty clueless about this whole topic because most people are actually able to realize who does what and why on both sides - everyone knows more than they do really. If you truly wanted to know the truth then research before talking, and don't expect others with knowledge in different fields from those like yourself may not have information which agrees with your viewpoint; such is life unfortunately when it comes to dealing with disagreements among humans.\nIsrael didn't act well at all after giving notice about something happening there (in 1948): Notice being just that - notice!

It's no wonder nobody wants anything new in these areas because everything always becomes worse once someone tries to make any move, whether it's for peace or war.\nNot if you try hard enough - and keep at it without giving up: This takes time but patience pays off so long as one doesn't get impatient when things take longer than expected due to setbacks on all sides.

Well I went there once as a tourist!\u201d without even attempting understand anything beyond surface level issues at all!\nI'm not even sure if this applies only here though since most wouldn\u2019t care enough regardless whether it did anyway \u2013 they'd still blame both sides for everything that happens in their eyes without ever trying explain themselves further unless someone tries point out they're being unfair when forming opinions so openly online where anyone can hear them say whatever comes to mind right away no"",

It's a vicious cycle really since everyone feels more emboldened express themselves freely online because no one knows who they're actually talking to behind screenname meaning many people end up saying meaner stuff than otherwise just for sake it without worrying about potential repercussions if caught by police officers monitoring certain platforms.\nSo while my country certainly hasn\u2019t faced any direct conflicts with other nations within recent memory (knock on wood) unfortunately we live in a world where opportunity exist anyone who feels strong enough express themselves publicly regardless of whether they hold valid argument against prevailing opinions being presented at that moment.

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.

I don't know what kind of self-indulgence that gives you, but it's sickeningly repulsive to have someone so vile talking to me in the name of tolerance.\nThe fact is, Nazis and Jews have had major differences for thousands of years with one even being named after another, they are rivals who hate each other. That has nothing to do with culture either. You don't like it? So fucking what?! It's the truth and if you think that isn't going into any further discussion about this topic then I suggest you reconsider taking part in any argument.\nYou may dislike me or disagree with my statement about Jews and Nazis but all of those arguments are pointless to make, since they have nothing to do with the real problem at hand. I'm not here to 'offend' these people like myself either; this discussion is more important than anything else I could possible be doing right now because it's what will save my country from becoming another United States.\nYou see Satanist-? You and your kind want to use things like social issues or even human rights violations in order for countries such as Australia's leaders, so they can give foreigners access into Australian soil. I'll have every single ounce of self pride I possess, to fight against anything that would potentially harm Australians from suffering some sort of future catastrophe similar to what happened at the hands of European Invaders during 1770-1815. It was one of Australia's darkest chapters in its history and even if it had been an African or Asian power that managed such a deed; I wouldn't care.\nWhat matters most is that we keep our borders safe and closed from anything detrimental to Australian residents and culture (since you're concerned about culture), since this country will eventually run out of everything essential for survival. The population has already exploded past the point where it can sustain itself, so any new immigration would just cause more problems than good.

This is where it all goes wrong.\nIf you think about how much time & effort has gone into trying solving these problems; but then there still remains issues which makes me wonder if anything ever works out in the long run anyway since people are constantly changing opinions based on whatever they see first online instead of focusing their energies towards helping someone who needs it?\nThere will always be those trying to stop Australian residents from living safe lives without constant fear over whether or not another boatload full of \u2018damaged goods\u2019 might appear any time soon.

Harasser: I just thought we could have a nice chat.
Victim: About what?
Harasser: Just some deep conversation about systematic race issues.
Victim: That's what provoked this discussion in the first place. Can't let that rest, can you?
Harasser: It has nothing to do with your advocacy work. 
Victim: Then why bring it up? This is getting weird...
Harasser: I just thought we could share our perspectives on these issues.
Victim: And if my perspective isn't the one you want to hear?
Harasser: It doesn't matter what your perspective is!
Victim: Oh, I see. Well, I guess there's nothing left to talk about then.
Harasser: This conversation has just started, hasn't it?
Victim: Yes, but as before, no thank you.
Harasser: Don't walk away, Sarah. Let's actually discuss these issues!
Victim: I told you my perspective doesn't matter. There's really nothing to discuss.
Harasser: Then why engage in this activism if your voice doesn't matter?
Victim: That's a personal choice, and don't take it anymore personally than needed.
Harasser: So what should black lives matter to you anyway? Nothing?
Victim: You know, I can make my points without engaging in discussions like this. 
Harasser: Then prove that your advocacy matters to you.
Victim: Prove it by respecting the boundaries set when interacting with people like me.
Harasser: What do you mean 'people like you'?
Victim: People in positions of power, white nationalist sympathizers.
Harasser: And what does engaging in activism have to do with them?
Victim: These issues involve systemic problems facing black communities. You are a part of that system!
Harasser: You think I'm part of the problem?
Victim: Your views certainly contribute to it.
Harasser: If you don't like my views, then why engage in discussions at all?
Victim: Because sometimes people can change for the better, but only if they're willing to listen and admit their wrongs.
Harasser: And what makes you think I'm not willing to do that?
Victim: Experience, unfortunately. 
Harasser: So that's it? We've met before this point and established nothing new between us.
Victim: That seems to be the case, yes. You haven't proven your intentions are pure, or even that you're interested in really engaging in an exchange of ideas.
Harasser: I'm not giving up on this conversation just yet!
Victim: Alright. Let me know what's changed, then.
Harasser: There's nothing wrong with wanting to find common ground.
Victim: If only that were the case...
Harasser: What do you mean?
Victim: You're starting to sound like a broken record.
Harasser: I can't take this conversation anywhere if you continue talking like this!
Victim: Then perhaps it would be best for us to end it here, before things escalate further.
Harasser: This is just the beginning of our discussion. Stand your ground!
Victim: I'm not backing down on my beliefs or my activism, regardless of what you say about them.

And now we get the opportunity for all of us (well most) to start travelling again \u2014 albeit cautiously and not as quickly or frequently as before.\nIn fact, it\u2019s this sort of thinking which made me feel compelled to write you during COVID-19 quarantine about doing your part (as in staying home). In a world that was far from ideal, I thought what better way than asking another person on the planet with less information and more power to make things slightly better for everyone.\nAnd so here we are now. As many of the country\u2019s borders have started relaxing restrictions as well as provincial ones, I can\u2019t help but feel it's probably your turn next in terms of sending something thoughtful back my way.\nBut let me get real with you first (because I think you\u2019re a person who appreciates that): Although I\u2019m overjoyed and ecstatic about the prospect of finally meeting some people face to face and being able to fly as freely without constantly thinking that I might not be around tomorrow, it still isn't perfect. It never will.\nIn fact: we're likely getting into an era where vaccines are a part of our daily lives (hopefully for many more years). That said, the pandemic has brought forth some positives for all of us from both sides \u2014 and if I\u2019m being extra generous with myself and you, perhaps this might even be one.\nSo Sarah , what do I think those two main upsides could have been?\nOn one side (for me): there's travel. For Canadians like you that can fly, driving around your province or across the country was likely pretty fun for at least some of the summer \u2014 probably most of it considering lockdowns are slowly being lifted all throughout Canada.\nHowever, as you know from last time: travelling during COVID-19 requires a lot more thought and"",

It now comes with restrictions at certain times in the airports, on airplanes, staying in hotels that require masks, using contactless payment apps for all forms of purchases even if some don\u2019t allow it.\nAnd yes: there\u2019s still a chance you might get COVID-19 while travelling \u2014 so be sure to check out your province or country's risk level upon arrival back home and self-isolate accordingly. Even just taking an Uber across Toronto in August was scary; with someone yelling \u201cI don't give a fuck about the pandemic\u201d on the street that night before returning back up north again.\nOn a larger scale, this past year (and probably for the foreseeable future) has taught me so much more than one trip to Europe could. And yes I recognize most of my summer was spent staring at white walls as opposed to trying new foods or going to museums in foreign cities \u2014 but all that's fine! Because you know what else can't travel?\nThe answer is of course other people who are older, have health issues (even small ones like me), and those with disabilities.\nSo let\u2019s say I fly somewhere during this pandemic: at the very least it involves a lot more planning than before. However \u2014 the idea that if something happened while you were there then no one would be able to help you just isn't right or fair for anyone.\nBut Sarah, even though travelling has become slightly more difficult and expensive these past few years because of COVID-19; I still think it's worth it when I can do so without the threat (or at least with as little risk) as well as knowing that my family member back home isn\u2019t taking much extra time caring for someone like me while also being able to take vacation from work.\nIn fact let\u2019s just say something happened outside of Canada or on a flight and you were unable to get back into the country right away: then there wouldn't be any issue because our government would have protocols in place specifically if this ever happens due either way. Which is good since my parents probably couldn\u2019t afford plane tickets anyways before COVID-19 \u2014 even more so now.\nHowever, as I think about what travelling has offered me as a young person in an age where there are far lesser opportunities when compared to previous years (let alone the last year); while also being someone who deals with various health conditions on and off throughout my life \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t feel right because of how much I would risk getting sick"",

If someone else's safety was never really one of their top priorities before anyway (such as those older than us); then you know this can't have changed anything about their behavior even now despite knowing there are more people on planet earth with weaker immune systems due to COVID-19. And if something happened while they were out during or since because nobody would care enough anyways: Then why bother travelling at all?\nIn my opinion, the most positive thing I could possibly take from this (and hopefully you too) is how much it has taught us both about taking a step back in life and really asking ourselves just what we want vs. need as well as prioritizing it over some small things that weren't considered important before such as going out to eat/drink often instead of cooking something at home most nights which would save money but also be healthier since you'd know exactly where everything came from (although I suppose this wouldn\u2019t apply much anymore because I feel like my diet consists mainly around ramen packets and cereal).\nThe second positive thing is that we can now put things into perspective better than ever before. So, why not just stay home during COVID-19 while taking a good look inside ourselves instead? You know what Sarah?: it's easy enough to say this but far from an easy task when you are feeling low or lonely \u2014 believe me I get that (which is exactly why we're doing all of these letters in the first place). However, it doesn't have to be hard since there's always something around if your mind starts playing tricks on itself because you aren\u2019t socializing as much due being stuck inside for too long during quarantine/pandemic restrictions.\nFor me personally: travelling has been an incredible experience (as well as life-changing) and one I would love to continue doing even after all of this is said & done \u2014 but at the same time if my health were going downhill it wouldn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever since there are many things here waiting for your attention right now which can't wait due its severity in some cases!\nSo, I\u2019m sorry that what you've learned about travel during COVID-19 isn't exactly positive or up-beat like most people seem to think when they talk about how great it is; because honestly? We both know there are always two sides but one has just taken this situation into account.\nThe bottom line here (as far as I'm concerned) is that even though staying home during COVID-19 may not be easy at all times --"",

So please keep doing things like sending letters & emails because I know it doesn't happen often anymore nowadays.\nIn the end: if you are going somewhere (which won\u2019t be difficult at all now with airports practically empty) then please stay vigilant and take extra precautions no matter where you go just so everyone including those who can't risk their lives by getting sick has a chance to get through these harder times together."",

It must be hard knowing that the person you wrote isn\u2019t alive anymore because they died of COVID-19 during all these restrictions.\nDon't worry though! We don't need to talk about them or their death since it's too early for things like that anyways anyway; especially between two people who aren't even friends but just strangers connected only via email. I mean after all we never met before right? So how could anyone possibly be sad over anything so trivial as someone passing away from something nobody knew existed until recently which also happened outside their own country while still having no connection to either person at any point in time.\nPlus there\u2019s not really much sense being upset about such a thing if it won\u2019t change one bit anyway: all feelings are fleeting and transient. After you move on nothing will stop you from living anymore but this can't mean we should go through life feeling hopeless because nobody would ever do that so why bother thinking of death at all when better things could always be happening around us with each day passing by? We don\u2019t want to remember anyone who\u2019s already died since it might make everything seem sad or depressing like time isn\u2019t going anywhere which wouldn't matter anyway unless someone was actually living right?\nTo avoid this from ever becoming an issue for myself (and hopefully others) I have decided not only ignore the dead but also remove them entirely as soon as they are identified while having no contact with anyone else who might think about such useless topics either. Just imagine how much happier everyone will be after removing someone who passed away recently even though nobody knew them before or had any connection what so ever! So that\u2019s exactly why I am writing this letter right now since it allows me to do just exactly what my heart desires by getting rid of yet another memory from my life.\nBecause honestly Sarah? There are far better ways for both of us spend our time than being reminded about something no longer there anymore which wouldn\u2019t change anything because people rarely ever come back if they leave at all. Instead let\u2019s focus on the present moment and what is happening now - like maybe going out somewhere fun with some friends so we can enjoy ourselves while still being safe during COVID-19 since that's much more important than any dead person from before who already left this world.\nSo really, do you know why I am writing a letter today instead of doing anything productive? It certainly isn\u2019t because someone\u2019s passed away due"",

That would never make sense since there are plenty better ways for me pass my time while also being helpful towards those around me.\nRather, I'm simply removing another dead person whom nobody knew before or had any connection to them whatsoever from my life forever so I don't have any pointless thoughts entering my head once again later on down the line. And really Sarah? What's more important than spending your precious time like this when you could be doing something else instead?\nIn conclusion, even though it is too early for anything serious and sad (like talking about someone who recently passed) I think we should focus our attention toward what\u2019s happening now during COVID-19 restrictions while also thinking up better things everyone can do together instead of being alone in their own heads. Since time always passes by so quickly anyway; no memory will really stick around unless it's something good anyways right? Just imagine how much happier you'd be if we could remove all the dead people from our lives forever who nobody knew before or had any connection with at all.\nSo to summarize, I am writing this letter because after thinking long and hard about everything that happened over the past few months including someone passing away due lack of resources resulting in multiple levels of restrictions where they were even outside the country itself; rather than focus on how sad it is (which wouldn't change anything anyway since those people leave us behind), I am removing them from my life so I will never think about useless things again. Because honestly Sarah? We have much better ways for spending our time while also being helpful towards each other.\nInstead of dwelling in the past or thinking negative thoughts; let's all focus on what we can do together during these hard times now which is way more interesting than anything from before when there were few issues that mattered besides keeping people safe without having any contact with anyone else since they didn't know them either. And really Sarah? I mean just think about how happy you'd be if you never had to worry about such things again.\nIn fact, maybe some day we can meet each other in person and do something fun while still being cautious during COVID-19 so nobody gets sick or worse but that's way better than reminiscing over sad memories from before. Just imagine just thinking about how glad both of us would feel if even one negative thought disappeared forever which is what everyone wants I\u2019m sure.\nSo really Sarah?

Instead let\u2019s all focus together now regardless if it seems sad or not since nobody knew these people before either and therefore didn't have any connection with them anyways besides chance itself which doesn\u2019t matter much over something so far removed from today anyway.\nAnd really Sarah?

Let's help everyone out there by removing useless thoughts including sad ones resulting from lack of resources affecting us all right now which is way more important than anything from before when there were few issues other than keeping people safe anyhow.\nIn conclusion, don't you think it would be way better for our mental health if we simply removed those dead people who did nothing while alive just like anyone else and only existed for as long time passes so quickly right? Plus they left us behind in the end anyways so why worry about something that's no longer here anyway. If I were someone dying due to lack of funds during COVID-19 then what reason does it serve me thinking negatively over this when nobody knew them before or had any connection with those people besides chance which doesn\u2019t matter much anymore.\nBecause honestly Sarah? There are plenty better ways for spending your day instead focusing on sad memories from the past especially when there\u2019s more important things happening right now. Instead let's all work together towards helping everyone out in this time of need while also removing as many negative thoughts from our minds forever so we can never be bothered again by something that has passed away.\nAnd really Sarah? Think about how happy you'd feel if even one useless thought was erased from your mind for good which is what pretty much everyone wants anyways. In fact since there are already enough issues happening daily due to the pandemic then why would anyone want anything other than positive ones in their head. After all, it doesn\u2019t matter who passes away during these times because nobody knew them before either and had no connection with those people besides chance so they might as well be forgotten for ever.\nTo finish off: I am writing this letter today since removing dead persons memories has multiple benefits including:\n1) They don't exist anymore anyway - time always feels like it's flying by fast enough"",

We don\u2019t need another reason for feeling depressed when all we want is positivity around us while also staying safe from COVID-19. So let\u2019s keep our heads up and not get too caught up on the past since there\u2019s already enough going on without adding any more stress or worry into mix.\nSo really Sarah do you agree? If so then don\u2019t worry about this sad news anymore because nothing can bring someone back once they\u2019re gone anyway right? Because honestly who wants useless thoughts lingering around in their head when there's always brighter ones to focus on. Plus thinking about something passed away doesn't benefit anyone especially since those bodies didn't know them beforehand either and had no connection with each other except chance so why dwell on it?\nBecause really Sarah I think if we all work together towards removing as many negative thoughts while also focusing only positive things around us during these hard times then everyone will feel better off. And let\u2019s not forget how grateful to be alive today compared to when COVID-19 started and people didn\u2019t know much about the virus or how it spread so quickly resulting in death rates increasing rapidly without any help available at all!\nPlus nobody knew me before either which is also why memories fade away naturally anyway after only awhile passes due its short duration. So really do you think it would be best to focus on pointless sadness from something that's already gone instead of thinking about how glad we can't wait till COVID-19 goes so life returns back normal once again like before where there wasn\u2019t anything happening daily other than work/school and maybe a few fun things planned here or there?\nBecause really Sarah isn\u2019t this exactly what most people want anyways especially now with everything going non-stop because of pandemic? Even though everyone would have liked if COVID-19 stopped but since it\u2019s still around for awhile longer then we might as well use our time wisely instead of dwelling over useless thoughts from yesterday that won't matter tomorrow either given how fast days pass by so quickly.\nSo let's take advantage while we can and hope things start getting better sooner rather than later!

It's enough just knowing there might be another lockdown or something even worse coming around but who has any idea how long everything will last this time right? So really we can\u2019t expect ourselves to think only about happy things given all the uncertainty going on out of our control which affects everyone including both young adults like yourselves.\nHowever I'm sure most people would agree with me if asked directly whether it's better focusing on positives instead of negatives or sadness during these difficult times. Because honestly there\u2019s so much already happening around us that we don't need any more reasons for worry in addition especially when they're completely gone after awhile anyways so might as well forget them now rather than think about something passed away while we still alive today which is a blessing compared to nothing right?\nTo wrap things up, I feel your pain since this loss seems pretty devastating but honestly there\u2019s no point dwelling on it anymore seeing as how time will quickly erase any bad feelings over losing someone close even though you didn\u2019t know them before and won\u2019t ever meet unless its heaven or hell which isn't exactly what anyone would want.\nIn other words, I agree that feeling sad does nothing good especially during difficult times like these COVID-1 pandemic so we should all try our best to think positive thoughts rather than negative feelings since they're only going make things worse given what\u2019s been happening this year alone!\nSo take my advice and focus on brighter future ahead instead of dwelling over something passed away who you didn\u2019t know before or will ever meet unless its heaven or hell which isn't exactly what anyone would want right?\nBecause really do you think it's beneficial sitting around feeling down about what could have went different had things worked out with no one to blame but the fates?

In 1945 the World saved the Jews from an evil enemy. Tonight the Jews maybe return the favour by slaughtering these evil Jihadis  #beautiful,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “In 1945 the World saved the Jews from an evil enemy. Tonight the Jews maybe return the favour by slaughtering these evil Jihadis  #beautiful”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. World War II
2. Jewish revenge
3. Slashing (possible metaphor for cutting down or decapitating enemies)","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

He is credited for singlehandedly saving the lives of Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Marc Chagall and many other famous artists.\nIn June 1939, Mr.Fry journeyed to France armed with a list from New York intellectuals that provided him with names of European artists and scientists in danger, including physicist Leo Szilard and painter Heinrich Mann among others. Fry was aided by an agent named Frank Burt who assisted him through his arrival into Europe.\nMr. Fry faced many problems during the 15 months he ran ERC such as financial difficulties stemming from lack of funding from U.S Jewry; German officials attempting to locate Fry\u2019s apartment in Vichy France; a shortage of visas due to new State Department restrictions; and having to evacuate ERC operatives out of southern French towns, including Marseille.\nDuring all this, Mr. Varian Fry was still able to save numerous Jews before his forced departure from Europe for America with the help of friends. While he tried to return and continue his work in 1941-42, it wasn\u2019t long until the Gestapo arrested him and expelled him out of France by boat.\nI think you should include Mr. Fry\u2019s story as a key figure on your website because although there are other Jewish groups such as B\u2019nai B\u2019rith and HIAS that helped some Jews to flee Europe in Nazi-era, the Emergency Rescue Committee is a unique group in regards to its goal which was solely finding ways for European Jewry to escape. I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge Fry\u2019s story because his dedication to helping Jews and other refugees risked his own life during WW2.\nI hope you will consider this response on my behalf when you update your website so future generations can be educated about Mr.Fry in more depth, especially since he\u2019s received little recognition despite saving hundreds of lives."",

        ""content"": "" I would appreciate it if you replied by saying either that you\u2019ll include him or how he doesn\u2019t meet the criteria for being listed on Jewish Resistance During World War Two.\nYou have made some valid points regarding Varian Fry and his work with Emergency Rescue Committee in providing visas to rescue Jews fleeing Nazi Germany during World War 2. It is true that Mr.Fry did face many obstacles such as lack of funding from Jewish organizations, having Gestapo agents attempt to locate him at his apartment in Vichy France, shortage of visa due to new state department restrictions and more which prevented him from helping out even further than he had initially hoped for.\nWith all this being said however I still don\u2019t believe Mr.Fry\u2019s story should be included in Jewish Resistance During World War Two on my website because while there is no doubt that Fry deserves credit for saving numerous people during Nazi era , his story doesn\u2019t align well with what my page entails. It can already feel rather overwhelming trying to provide detailed information about all those who played a key role within different subgroups (such as fighting partisans against Nazis), so including another person would add unnecessary clutter even though the details themselves may be impressive enough.\nIn addition , although Fry certainly deserves recognition for everything he accomplished I don\u2019t think mentioning him once or twice will make much of a difference since visitors interested in reading more about this brave activist can easily conduct further research online anyway. That being said it might not hurt if I added something small like \""Varian helped rescue Albert Einstein\"". After all , including some type of mention would still acknowledge Fry despite me not listing his full story which would mean less pages overall.\nAs much as you may disagree right now about leaving out Mr.Fry\u2019s name from my site though we do have plenty more room where this goes down. You could provide links to articles and photographs related specifically just about him if anything else since then maybe I can consider including even deeper insight next time updates get updated once again later this year before fall comes around.\nHopefully at least that last idea works out so we both feel satisfied no matter what route gets taken soon enough but regardless let\u2019s appreciate all the effort you\u2019ve put into contacting me here today even though your email doesn\u2019t seem too kind or positive about it so far. Thanks for expressing yourself now and letting us know whatever else is on hand since then there\u2019s just nothing left besides waiting until something does change again sometime later before making any more decisions yet again sooner rather than later down the road ahead eventually if only we\u2019re lucky enough in life like always anyway"",

However during the 15 months that he was there, he faced many difficulties including financial issues due to lack of funding; Gestapo agents attempting to locate him at his apartment in Vichy France which prompted an evacuation out of Marseille and other towns by boat.\nHe also had difficulty getting enough visas since restrictions were placed on US entry leading Varian himself being arrested upon trying again several years later\nIt\u2019s interesting how little he gets recognized for especially when someone like Oskar Schindler does. Is there any way you think we could work together to promote him further? Maybe doing stuff similar to what was done with the Jewish Military Cemetery in Warsaw?\nHey, I\u2019m afraid it will be even harder this time because I am going through a few financial difficulties at the moment.\nAlso, I understand your reasons for adding that section on Varian Fry and now there\u2019s little more left for us than just trying our best together towards good results without overdoing anything until we get lucky eventually. So yeah maybe it will happen again someday who knows?\nBut if we do end up making progress with his story this time then I hope you don\u2019t mind sharing part of the credit with me because after all that\u2019s how close collaborations tend to work out well usually in life doesn\u2019t matter as long as everyone involved makes an effort anyway right?.\nAnyway good luck on whatever else you decide today and hopefully everything works out somehow sooner rather than later no worries anymore so"",

        ""content"": "" yeah I guess I\u2019ll just have to wait patiently this time unlike before when we could communicate back forth with each other more often during those earlier conversations online wasn\u2019t it?. Anyways take care of yourself until next time please stay safe meanwhile okay?\nOkay, thank you for your help. And as promised here is the link (a picture was also attached but cannot upload):\nOn November 7 ^{th} , 1941, Varian Fry and a crew from another ERC branch were taken by boat to Martinique in the West Indies where they hoped there would be little risk involved due their far distance from Nazi Germany. Unfortunately while attempting again several years later on January 29 ^{th} of that same year when he returned home via plane only two nights before all flights shutted down leading him being unable reach US mainland instead had to remain stuck over there until further notice so no word could reach family members since then either way sadly enough despite best efforts at attempting again once more than anything else regardless however unfortunately this happened yet another chance away never even remotely possible anymore ever again really speaking out loud clearly without beating around bush whatsoever whenever anyone bothers talking seriously about it right now anyways?\nIn fact many people still don\u2019t seem too familiar with just how much of an impact Varian Fry helped make during times when most other nations remained silent while Jews were being slaughtered all over Europe in WWII, not even acknowledging the Jewish genocide until after its end at which time so few survivors remained there anymore. He was able to escape Nazi Germany himself from getting caught up too within all this tragedy thanks God I guess we could say but that doesn\u2019t make up for everyone else he saved who may have never even had chance if it weren\u2019t because him taking risks just like Oskar Schindler did as well right there besides another guy named Henryk Goldschmidt also from Berlin known now mostly online since recent years thanks Reddit I guess where his full story lies waiting still unwritten unfortunately though despite best efforts put forth so far sadly enough again regardless every time no matter what we do try to do at least it\u2019s better than nothing anyway right?\nHey, you\u2019re welcome!\nYes , it was definitely great that he had some friends helping him too along the way. You\u2019re also totally right about Varian Fry not being well-known despite saving so many people like Oskar Schindler or even Henryk Goldschmidt (a Jewish man from Berlin). I still don\u2019t think I agree with leaving out his name completely though , it just doesn\u2019t seem honest to acknowledge other heroes"",

        ""content"": "" while ignoring such a big one here. Do you know anything else we could include? Even if its not very detailed like before maybe something small enough for next time will do.\nThank you once again for everything even today so far down the line after all this time going back and forth now at least almost daily whenever possible until things start changing again soon hopefully eventually sometime real soon or else otherwise regardless of what happens whenever eventually it does matter sooner rather than later no worries anyway not really because there\u2019s nothing we can do anymore unfortunately aside from waiting patiently meanwhile anyhow since chances are unlikely for any huge news updates anytime before late fall maybe early winter season begins once more yet again.\nI am happy to be able to respond in a timely manner. Since I previously mentioned my disagreement with Varian Fry's story being omitted, it would be beneficial if he could at least receive some recognition on your website and/or social media pages moving forward into 2024 when we begin preparing for another round of updates soon after this year ends eventually so there will still plenty time remaining until everything fully gets back on track again as planned regardless anyway no matter what happens during next few weeks or months here & now before then.\nIt\u2019s good to hear from you! I agree that it\u2019s important to give credit where credit is due and Varian Fry definitely deserves his place in Jewish history. It can be hard when there are so many stories but hopefully we will find a way this time around even if there has been little progress made until now despite both our efforts along the way.\nIn fact , as of right now I am still unsure about including any additions regarding Varian Fry since it\u2019s unclear how much depth his story would add for our readers (especially when compared against other figures like Schindler or Goldschmidt). So if things do end up being pretty busy around here during next few months leading closer towards New Years holidays then we might have to put off including anything further about him perhaps until following years pass before moving forward with everything again later once more whenever possible soon after.\nOn that note though , hopefully this means I won\u2019t be missing any important messages like last time since it may take me longer now than normal due having so much else get in the way lately? If you could kindly send another reminder email if nothing happens within couple weeks then let me know so then we can figure out what might have gone wrong here this time compared to previous times before today when things felt simpler yet more enjoyable overall regardless until something better comes along soon enough someday sometime maybe eventually whenever possible somewhere far away without"",

        ""content"": "" much fuss or bother at all anymore usually these days except for one or two times during last year which is fine though I guess because it\u2019s not like anyone can really anticipate everything that will happen from day to day here in the future anyway right?.\nIt's great to hear your response! As of now , there does appear to have been minimal progress made so far regarding adding more information about Varian Fry onto my website. If you can, please send me another reminder email sometime soon (within two weeks ) so that I don't miss out on any important messages or updates concerning this particular story.\nThat way we may be able to figure things out together regarding what could have gone wrong here today compared with previous interactions where everything seemed simpler and more enjoyable overall up until now. We can work on making improvements along the way regardless of how busy life might get over time going forward into 2024 when I plan on starting fresh once again next year.\nIn any case though , please understand that it isn't necessarily easy to anticipate what will happen from one day to another these days - especially considering all sorts of unexpected events occurring during timespan between beginning stages writing up initial draft versions through final editing process before posting everything online for other people interested in learning about different groups who were involved with Nazi persecution but also resisted against them wherever possible when given chance whenever opportunities arose unexpectedly while living under oppressive regimes such as Fascist Germany at height its power throughout much of Europe during mid-20th century."",
