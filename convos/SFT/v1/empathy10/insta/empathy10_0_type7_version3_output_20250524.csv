Ah ugly_,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Ah ugly_”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insult
2. Ugliness
3. Appearance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

I just saw your post about performing guitar solo.
Victim: Thanks! It was such a rewarding experience.
Harasser: Yeah, it must have been great. But I think you could try harder with your appearance.
Victim: Well, everyone has their own style. And I'm proud of who I am.
Harasser: It's just that...you could do better. You know, to attract more followers or even fans.
Victor: I don't think my look will change. This is who I am and this is what people can expect from me.

Harasser: You're such a hypocrite then. 
Victim: That's not fair to say. Is there something else bothering you?

Victim: What you’re telling me is unnecessary and doesn't contribute anything constructive to our conversation.
Harasser: You always have that comeback ready don’t you?
Victim: No, I'm honestly just here to engage in meaningful conversations. And when there are no productive discussions we can start exploring other topics or end the conversation.

        ""content"": "" I was wondering if playing a piece like \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d on electric is better or worse than acoustic, in terms of making it easy for other people to listen to. What do you think?\nThank you for reaching out and asking such an interesting question!\nWhen choosing which instrument to play a particular song it\u2019s important that both the composer intention as well as audience experience are factored into the equation. Let me use Vivaldi \u201cFour Seasons,\u201d Opus 8, RV297 as an example.\nThe Four Season is one of the most famous and recognizable Baroque pieces with each season having its own theme.\nWinter for instance opens up to a harsh environment through freezing temperatures, falling snowflakes etc. In this work it is suggested that the sound produced to create atmosphere should be sharp, staccato, roughness, tremolo as well as a lack of legato in order to represent cold and icy conditions accurately (see sheet music below).\u00a0\nSpring on the other hand portrays an awakening of nature with bird chirping, flowing brooks, gentle breezes etc \u2013 all contributing towards creating light playful sounds. This was done through delicate notes produced by plucking strings using your fingertips rather than a pick.\nFurthermore since Baroque times composers used specific types of instruments designed to create certain textures so that together they tell one story or narrative- something which cannot be replicated on electric guitar alone due to its sound being too distinct unlike other classical ones. Therefore when choosing between playing acoustics or electrics depends upon what emotions do you want your listeners feeling while hearing this masterpiece?\nThat said, there is nothing stopping someone from performing the piece using just an electric instrument and I believe that can still work as long as they take time to learn how best utilize its capabilities such sound effects (distortion), sustain pedals etc., which might be difficult without prior knowledge around recording technology used during recordings etc. In closing then whether one chooses acoustic vs electric depends mainly upon personal preference but should also consider context \u2013 e.g., venue space available equipment needed accessibility required etc..

Shut up,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Shut up”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Condescending tone
3. Silencing attempt","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

The last thing we\u2019re going to do is tell the government that it\u2019s wrong and they should stop doing stuff we disagree with. Obviously, we\u2019re more effective if we just pretend like nothing was ever bad so the bad things could keep happening!\nThis isn\u2019t something new though. In fact in 1922 Lenin created a secret police force called the GPU (Russian secret service) to combat growing opposition of all sorts from his own people as well as the western countries that were fighting against the Bolshevik regime with their armies.\nIn 1930, he changed it again into NKVD and by 1940 over two million \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d citizens had been imprisoned or deported; while another five million people (including entire families) perished in forced labor camps. In addition many historians say Stalin ordered executions ranging up to seven times higher than Lenin\u2019s total death toll.\nWhy is it happening? It all comes down too much trust by society members on authority figures who have power over them . They don\u2019t realize how corrupt these people can be because most want good things like safety from crime and being fed so badly ,so any time they try doing anything against\nThe government will respond with force! How could you think otherwise? Do the math, if half of your population is unemployed or underemployed (as in a minimum wage job), how do expect people to live? If someone has no other option but to resort illegal activities because law enforcement won\u2019t help them get out from poverty traps due\nto lack funding resources , then what are they going suffer consequences for breaking the rules enforced upon them ? That\u2019s exactly why there needs to exist strong surveillance systems which can monitor everything going around every corner even if its happening behind closed doors \u2013 otherwise people might act up without fear being caught. The more we enable citizens ability for private information gathering / sharing, then\nthe easier it becomes for law enforcement officials catch criminals red handed! So yeah..

The point is, no matter what system you pick ,there will always be a need for law enforcement since people cannot\nbe allowed to commit crimes against each other with NO consequences.

@christinamilian is such a fool!!!,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “@christinamilian is such a fool!!!”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Rhetorical question
2. Anger
3. Foolishness","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to direct ridicule.""}","Given an online harassment scenario, you should start from a storytelling perspective and generate a conversation based on a given scenario on a private messaging platform between a harasser and a victim. Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

In fact it would be fun (if not as boring as the global collapse of Earth systems) so let\u2019s give this another chance to see if you are truly interested in understanding what actual science says on the subject.\nWhat do scientists mean by \u201cGlobal Warming Hoax\u201d?\nIn short, there isn\u2019t because the media is no longer covering stories related specifically about climate change. They used those as excuses before because they believed in man-made global warming themselves but now with recent data showing that this theory lacks any scientific evidence many news outlets don\u2019t feel compelled to report on it anymore either due to lack of interest or just general apathy amongst the public towards what\u2019s happening around Earth right below our feet. If people aren\u2019t talking about something, then what else can explain why journalists continue covering stories that have no relevance? We\u2019ll get back into this later but for now let me give another example.\nWhat do other scientists mean by \u201cthe global warming hoax\u201d?\nFor the past century there has been a growing number of climatologists and geophysicists who believe Earth is undergoing an unprecedented episode in its geological history. They argue that today we are witnessing some sort of planetary catastrophe brought about mainly through human actions; namely via industrialization, deforestation, agriculture which all contribute towards greenhouse gas emissions causing significant alterations at both physical (i.e., melting ice sheets) and chemical levels within the biosphere as well as changes in weather patterns globally including higher average temperatures than ever recorded before!\nIf you think your article has more to it then go ahead and try again.\nAs a scientist I\u2019m really excited because this will be our first step towards having a great discussion! So I hope we can have fun together while doing some serious talking which may lead everyone involved into learning something new not only about how little they know but also why those who understand the issues surrounding climate change are becoming more and more vocal with each passing day.\nYou say that recent data shows man-made global warming lacks scientific evidence. Can you please point me to this data? Is it published in peer reviewed journals"",

After all, that\u2019s what being a scientist really means: trying every time again with new information until an agreement is reached no matter how difficult it may seem sometimes.\nI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have lots more fun doing this because I don\u2019t want my readers missing out on such amazing topics discussed between two smart people who actually know something about everything related to natural sciences!\nHow Can We Help Protect Our Planet Earth?\nThere are many ways in which all of us can help. From recycling, using renewable energy sources or just reducing the carbon footprint by living more sustainable lives.\nIf every citizen took steps towards conserving electricity and water resources globally today there would be a significant reduction in GHGs emitted into atmosphere each year! Even something as simple as turning off electric appliances when not in use could make huge differences over time if everyone did it together. By becoming proactive instead of waiting for politicians or scientists to come up with solutions we can achieve real change!\nAnd I think this should definitely continue since Earth may be our only home after all.\nSo let\u2019s keep learning from each other while trying hard to figure out what is best way forward regarding future of life support system planet earth provides us currently and going forward\u2026\nIt has been a pleasure engaging in conversation with you, but unfortunately (for my readers) my time is over.\nAnd now for the real scientists:\nThe Real Climate Scientists Say This Is No Joke\n\u201cClimate change isn\u2019t an opinion.\u201d \u2013 Michael Mann, Pennsylvania State University. \u201cScience tells us that human-created carbon emissions are driving climate changes around our planet.\u201d\n\u2013 Gavin Schmidt, NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies.

And now because of how bad science is handled nowadays, real climate change researchers are the one being attacked by people who don\u2019t believe in any reality.\nIn conclusion we can see that since 95%+ of scientists agree about something then it must really happen but when there\u2019s just 1 nutter out their acting like a fool everyone starts doubting all those other reputable sources!

The best way forward in solving our planet\u2019s problems now may very well come down to cooperation between individuals rather than having one single voice dictate policy decisions without input from others whose expertise is being ignored.\nIt has been said before: \u201cA wise man once told me that if you have a hammer, everything looks like nails.\u201d Unfortunately it seems most of today's so called scientific community seems hell-bent on using their \""big bang theory\"" as justification for everything regardless whether there even exists any solid proof other than some computer model predictions which change wildly over months or years \u2013 why do people think this will remain true forever?\nI don't have all the answers; however I would like everyone out in public domain understand that no matter how much evidence you show towards a certain viewpoint, nothing's set until it actually happens so please speak up rather staying quiet! The more voices raised against injustice especially those with substantial arguments backing them up, increases chances for positive change. This applies to BOTH sides - whether advocating pro or anti environmental action since we need both perspectives equally represented if balance is ever going achieve.\nThe fact remains that regardless which team one supports ultimately neither will succeed unless they work together towards achieving mutual goals \u2013 after all as I said time and again, \u201ctwo heads are better than one.\u201d\nLet's hope folks realize this soon before Earth gets destroyed beyond repair\nAs another old saying goes: A bad penny always returns.

Home wrecking ass hoe...Laura and Gloria should have beat that ass????”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insulting language
2. Location references
3. Accusatory tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

        ""content"": "" Welcome to the wonderful world of Python programming. In this post, we will guide you through creating a simple calculator program in PyQT5.\n\nPyQt is an extensively used and well-written GUI toolkit for Python that provides powerful C++-derived class libraries, bindings for many different types of functionality in one cohesive package (like database access interfaces), so it can quickly create desktop applications running on all major operating systems such as Windows\u2122, Linux\u00ae, MAC OS X \u2122.\n\nLet\u2019s get started!\n\n## Project Requirements\n\nIn this post we are going to use:\n\n  - PyQT5 \u2013 a Python binding for the popular C++ GUI toolkit Qt.\n  - NumPy \u2013 a library used mainly in the field of scientific computing and mathematical programming; it is developed by a community with many other contributors, which includes some of the core developers (who created NumPy) and various universities around world.\n\nIn addition to downloading PyQt5 we\u2019ll need:\n\n## Creating The Project\n\nWe\u2019re going start off by creating an empty Python project. To do so open PyCharm , create a new File in your workspace folder and save it as calculator.py .\n\nNow add these import statements which include the packages we are using:\n```\nfrom PyQt5.QtCore    import *\nfrom PyQt5.QtGui     import *\nfrom PyQt5.Qsci      import QScintilla, QSciStyle\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import (QApplication,\n  QMainWindow,QDialog,\n   QVBoxLayout)\nimport sys\n\n# Required for NumPy functions to work on Windows \nos.add_dll_directory(\""C:/Program Files/NumPy\"")\n```\n## Creating The Calculator Class\n\nNow let\u2019s create a class named calculator() which is going inherit the QDialog type.\n```\nclass Calc(QMainWindow):\n    def __init__(self, parent = None) -> None:\n        super().__init__ (parent)\n```\n### Setting Up UI Elements For A Simple Calculator\n\nNext we need to setup our window and some of it\u2019s properties. You can do this by adding the appropriate lines within this newly create init function like below.\n```\n   self.setMinimumSize(275, 235)\n    central_widget = QWidget(self)    \n    calc_ui_layout_box = QVBoxLayout()   \n    central_widget.setLayout(calc_ui_layout_box)\n\n    # Set up calculator text area as our main widget.  \n    self.calc_text_area = QScintilla (central_widget,\n      readOnly=True\n      ) \n\n    calc_ui_layout_box.addWidget (\n        # Make a placeholder for the result on each line at end of"",
        ""role"": ""user"",
        ""name"": ""Davidp456""
    },
    {
        ""agent"": ""Davidp456"",
        ""content"": "" equation    \n        QLabel (\""Result:\"")) \n     # Add the widget to central area     \n     calc_ui_layout_box.addWidget(self.calc_text_area)\n```\nLet\u2019s break down what we have done above.\n\nWe\u2019re first setting some properties; MinimumSize is specified in pixels and allows us the adjust how big our window opens up when it runs. Then inside init method which handles all initialization logic after calling super to initialize parent class.\nThen central_widget gets created as another child of QMainWindow . And next I\u2019m using layout managers like QVBoxLayout() \u2013 for vertical placement within self.centralWidget. Finally setting widgets to their respective parents with addWidget ()."",

        ""content"": "" In this case we\u2019re creating a QScintilla object named input area and placing it inside calcui layouts box that serves up multiple functions simultaneously while also making sure there\u2019s some space left over at bottom (by adding QLabel ) where we show value of equation right now since calculation hasn\u2019t been done yet.\n\n### Adding Calculator Buttons\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and add the actual buttons. In Qt, for a button you need to create an instance of QPushButton then append it as child inside layout of parent container widget.\n```\nself.addButton = QPushButton (\""1\"")\n     self.calc_ui_layout_box.addWidget (self.addButton)\n     # Repeat with remaining numbers from 2-9\n\n      self.zeroButton = QPushButton(\""0\"")\n\n     self.clearButton =QPushButton(\""Clear\"")    \n         self.calculateButton =QPushButton(\""Calculate\"")   \n\n# Place buttons where appropriate \n\n       ...\n```\nAt this point your class should look like so:\n```\nclass Calc(QMainWindow):\n    def __init__(self, parent=None) -> None:\n        super().__init__ (parent)\n\n        # Set minimum size for our window\n      self.setMinimumSize(275, 235)\n      central_widget = QWidget(self)\n       calc_ui_layout_box = QVBoxLayout()\n       central_widget.setLayout(calc_ui_layout_box)\n\n         # Create Scintilla object as main widget \n       self.calc_text_area = QScintella (central_widget,\n          readOnly=True)\n           calc_ui_layout_box.addWidget (\n            QLabel(\""Result:\""))\n             # Add the widget to central area\n    calcUiLayoutBox.addWidget(self.inputArea)\n```\n## Handling Button Input Events\n\nNext let\u2019s take each button and add functionality when it is pressed by connecting their presses with functions we will create later. To do this you need to first get hold of all buttons in your program like so:\n```\nself.addButton\n    # Repeat for remaining numbers from 2-9 \n       ...\n   self.zeroButton = QPushButton(\""0\"")\n      ...\n\n# Place the following line after adding last button (zero) \nbuttons_layout = QGridLayout()\n       buttonsLayout.addLayout(numberButtons, 1,0 , 4)\n```\nAnd then connect them to their appropriate event handlers like this:\n```\n def clearBtnEvent():\n    global calc_textArea\n        # Clear contents of text area with result at bottom  \n   calc_txtArea.setText (\""\"")\n\ndef calculateBtnClicked () :\n     global calcTextArea\n\n         try : \n       # Get the equation as string from textarea\n           equation = self.calcTextArea.toPlainText()"",

        ""name"": ""Davidp456""

        ""agent"": ""Davidp456"",
        ""content"": "" These exceptions may occur due to things such as non-numeric entries or division by zero.\n\n## Displaying Results\n\nNow let\u2019s create the displayNumberPressed function which displays what button has been pressed onto your screen.\n```\ndef inputTextUpdated () -> None:\n    global operatorSign\n        if len(self.calcTextArea.toPlainText()) == 0: \n            self.calcTextArea.setText(\""\"")\n             return\n\n       # Get previous value from text area        \n      oldValue = float (self.calcTextArea.toPlainText())\n\n  # Handle when division sign shows up       \n   elif \""/\"" in operatorSign and '/' not in currentValue :    \n     msgBox(\""Division by Zero!\"")\n        self.clearInput()\n\n  else:                                  \n    displayNumberPressed()\n```\nThis is basically what happens when ever you press a number button on your keyboard. If len(self.calcTextArea.toPlainText ()) returns true then it means that there was no characters entered before so just set the value of the Text Box to empty string . Then get old Value by setting this new thing after getting rid off any operators we might have typed earlier because they don\u2019t belong in our answers! To figure out what came before use len on everything inside () and if it\u2019s bigger than zero then display Number Pressed\n\nNow let\u2019s create a function named calculate to perform calculations once the user presses enter.\n```\ndef calculateBtnClicked ():\n    global operatorSign\n    try:\n       equation = self.calc_textArea.toPlainText()\n        # Clear out old value before display new one   \n      except :\n           msgBox(\""Sorry, there was an error!\"")\n          return\n\n# Create list of valid operators: -, +. /* \n   operators = [\""-\"",\""+\"",\""/\"", \""*\""]\n```\nI used global here so that anything assigned or modified by a function inside self will also be reflected outside it (in all instances). Here I\u2019m using the NumPy package to perform maths on our equations and return their answers as strings like so:\n```\ndef calculateBtnClicked():    \n    global operatorSign\n     try: \n       # Get equation from text are   \n         equation = self.calcTextArea.toPlainText()\n           old_val = float (equation)\n            new_val = eval(equation)\n   except ZeroDivisionError :\n        msgBox (\""Oops! Something went wrong!\"", QMessageBox().Warning(),\n          \""Division by zero isn't cool man!\"")\n     outputText = \""Result: {x}\"". format((new_value)) \n       self.calcTxtarea.setText(output_text) \n\n# Place calls for the above created functions like"",

    {
        ""agent"": ""Davidp456"",
        ""content"": "" so...\n   ...\nself.clearBtn.clicked.connect (clearBtnEvent)\n```\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAnd that\u2019s it; we\u2019re done! You now have a working calculator written in Python, utilizing PyQT5 for user interface design \u2013 which is a pretty awesome combo if you ask me.\n\nHowever don\u2019t be surprised if your finished product looks nothing like the image above. This was just an example project and there are many other ways to style any program using PyQT5 (or really anything), so have fun experimenting!"",

To make PyQT identify that as our clickEvent we will need type cast it in order not get an exception like AttributeError because currently this is just string . Once you\u2019ve done that paste the line from your clipboard inside Calc ()\u2019s init method.\n```\n addStretch (0)\n    buttons_box.setLayout(buttonsLayout)\n\n   # Connect Press Events For Each Button\n     addButton.clicked.connect(lambda : displayNumberPressed(\""1\""))\n         ...\n                   zeroButton.clicked.connect(self.zeroBtnEvent )\n                    clearButton .\n            clicked . connect (\n        lambda:: self.clearBtnEvent() , \n       calculateButton .click. (  self, calculateBtnClicked()))\n```\n## Displaying Results\n\nNow we want to add functionality for displaying results once the enter button has been hit.\n\nFor this I created a new function named outputTxtArea().\n```\ndef OutputTextArea () -> None:\n    global operatorSign , old_value , new_value\n\n         # Get string of equation from text area      \n          formula = self.calc_textArea .toPlainText()\n       try : \n            # Calculate answer and format to show in textbox     \n             display_value = \""Result: {x}\"".format(new_val) \n\n               except :\n                   msgBox (\""Oops, something went wrong!\"") \n              return\n      # Set result into the output area as a string        \n        self.calc_text_area.setText (displayText)\n     # Clear out old value before displaying calculation results  \n    calc_txtArea.clear()\n```\nNext we add an EnterPressed event to our calculator class which calls that function when return is pressed.\n```\n# Connect Press Events For Each Button\n  addButton.clicked.connect(lambda : displayNumberPressed(\""1\""))\n             ...\n                       clearButton .clicked.connect (\n                      lambda:: self. )\n                       , calculateButton .\n                     clicked(\n                self, calculateBtnClicked(),\n        ), calcTextAea.returnPressed.connect(OutputTextBox()))\n```"",

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Sleep criticism
3. Shower recommendation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Victim: I enjoy sharing my fitness journey with others. Thank you for your concern though!

Victim: It's unfortunate that you find it boring because many people like to see the progress and growth of their favorite influencers.
Harasser: Whatever. Here’s a better idea, why don't you stop talking about yourself so much and actually interact with your followers?

Victim: Cold showers are a great way to wake up and improve circulation.
Harasser: Pfft. I bet you never actually take one because you're too lazy. You probably just post about it to make yourself sound impressive.
Victim: My routine is centered around my personal health, just like many others. It may be aspirational or a form of self- motivation for some readers.
Harasser: Wow, that's deep. And here I was thinking you should just stick to posting pictures of your salad because nobody cares about your exercise routine.
Victim: I understand this might not be relatable to you since it seems like it's just something enjoyable for me during my fitness journey.

It took me a long time to learn when my body was telling me it wasn't ok, and just listen.. I used to do everything for fun - running up hills, playing netball, but once the fun stopped, it was time to take notice... so i stopped.

How many times a day might they need to use them?\nIn order not lose weight, one doesn't have eat any less (if he donates 1 kg/week it's alright). If the person still needs to reduce his weight by 10kg over two years, he must eat ~200 calories daily less. So the best strategy is - go to do sport and lose weight!\nIt would be helpful if you got a job that was mostly physical like landscaping or something.\nThat depends on her personality type and preference for activity. I myself get bored easily so going in circles around a course seems stupid, but many people enjoy walking in nature. Also, doing stuff with other people always helps as it gets your mind off of how your body feels.\nIf you think that's what they're talking about, I suggest you talk to them first before assuming...\nI can agree here! There isn't really any harm done by simply giving someone advice on the topic either. It may seem like an intrusion of privacy at times but in this case it is helping people and that should always be seen as a good thing.\nWhat are your top 3 favourite things to do when you're feeling anxious/low? What types of things can friends or family members get you involved with?\nWell not really, because i have no anxiety problems. Though if I were in such a mood, I would take some time off from all my worries and stressors, like reading books which makes me distracted.\nThere's nothing wrong with what they're doing!! They are just offering up advice to help them improve something that is a matter of great concern to them. If someone was asking for this type of advice it means that they probably aren't getting enough interaction around these issues so don't worry, there won't be any awkwardness!\nI totally agree! I mean in some ways you might say talking about personal topics makes people uncomfortable sometimes and some may get offended but the benefits should outweigh it. As long as everyone is civil then its fine.\nThe person needs support, friends can help keep a positive attitude\nOh i see...

There has been times when someone I knew opened up something that I should have kept quiet as if someone was trying to solve their problem but couldn't or didn't know how. That's why instead of being open you could keep a sense of calm and ask the other person: \""Is it OK for me to be here?\"" They'll answer honestly.\nThe reason people don't want you involved is because there are certain things in life that are meant to stay between two individuals as private matters. Just as someone wouldn't go behind and open others mail or snoop through their stuff, they probably have some sort of confidence from sharing this specific subject with only one another...

However if they are hiding things that can cause serious problems in the future its just safer not to pry into other people's personal lives.\nHey SarahLyn!! People get sad for different reasons, a couple of those most common being because we have been hurt or disappointed about something or because sometimes life doesn't turn out exactly how you thought it would.

I guess its possible some people don\u2019t want to express themselves because there are only certain individuals that they feel comfortable speaking to about particular issues at first glance (or ever).

This behavior may be due to a few reasons: 1) It is something personal/sensitive. 2) They simply are not interested in solving this problem right now.

Or maybe it makes them uncomfortable hearing about your daily struggles (I bet those are tough). Perhaps instead of trying so hard, try not being overly dramatic and express yourself through actions- show off all the cool new things you do. You never know...that might spark some fun conversations down the road.\nSometimes people don\u2019t always want us to interfere since our intentions may differ from theirs (i.e., if a stranger were talking about how he was sad because no one took interest in learning more of his culture).

Nigga u ain't got no job man,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Nigga u ain't got no job man”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Verbal aggression
2. Lack of employment
3. Racial slur","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

You can't have two different users and a folder open in Outlook with the same emails without duplicating everything in there or deleting some of them which can cause issues so I guess at best what you could do is export one user (maybe using IMAP) into your own account.\nAnother option would be to use something like an E-mail archive or PST file but if this one has multiple folders then it might become a big hassle too because there's no real way of moving all messages from let say Inbox1 into your Archive folder while leaving them on user A so as not to confuse her. You could maybe create the same folders for yourself in case those exist and move everything or export from that account into another one with an archive add-on like Outlook Assistant.\nThis may just be a coincidence but it seems like Windows hasn't added any updates since June when you started getting these messages? So I would try updating your PC to see if this problem disappears, perhaps something has broken there as well. To do so go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and download whatever is available (except for the optional ones).\nAlso check your antivirus software or 3rd party firewall because sometimes they can interrupt some parts of updates in which case re-installing them might help.\nIn either scenario though, if an update fails once then it's a good sign there could be multiple issues that are blocking future downloads. If this is not the problem maybe we should start"",

The first thought that comes up is a hardware problem but then there's also a chance of malware being involved in here because these messages can appear when Windows gets corrupted as well and who knows how long they stay hidden?\nIf I were you though, I'd ask someone else to try connecting with their phones since it doesn't always behave like this if your phone is malfunctioning somewhere; so then at least we'll get better insight on whether there\u2019s a problem coming from them or not."",

I also had the same avatar before switching from GMail/Gsuite.\nThe last time this happened they were calling my character name (Felix) while speaking English but when talking to another student that used a different language he'd use Felix's original name in Korean instead of his real first name so it wasn't exactly something intentional on their part. At least I hope not anyways since there was no actual malice involved unlike many other scenarios involving these kinds of things online.\nIf your computer has Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise installed then yes you can connect to remote desktop via RDP without a limit but only after installing the Remote Desktop Host component through settings or PowerShell; https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/install-the-remote-desktop-host-component-on-windows-10/ba-p/1491088 . If you're using Home though then there's no way to get it as far as I know but it might be possible if someone has found a solution for that already!\nThe only issue is that some third-party anti-virus scanners will block the process and refuse to allow connection attempts which would prevent me from getting connected remotely. If that happens, what can I do other than disconnect or open another account in TeamViewer like before? Is there any way around those blocks without restarting my PC over again every time it happens?\nAs an alternative though you might want to consider checking out https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procexp#using-process-explorer instead if nothing else comes up since this tool allows one to view information about running apps/services etc., including whether certain programs are connecting with specific IPs or other machines (if that's part of your interest). For example someone could use Wireshark too although it will require more effort in terms of setting everything properly which may be a bit complex.\nI mean, the problem is you don't actually know for sure why they're being blocked and I can guarantee there's nothing Microsoft does on its end that would have caused this whatsoever since no code changes occurred recently nor any bugs were found.

In my opinion they seem to be unrelated but not completely impossible either if certain restrictions are involved in some way; though again unlikely since no code changes were done recently that would explain it unless one of the employees changed something else accidentally (like setting up VPN tunnels). Anyway let's see what we can gather before jumping to any drastic measures which could cause even bigger problems.\nI'm sorry but I am unable to view the full conversation between you two as well since messages on Facebook get deleted automatically after 24 hours unless someone saves them beforehand; so without that information it'll be hard for me say whether or not he was using multiple accounts. My only suggestion right now is waiting until another message appears from him then you can look at his profile and see if any links lead to old posts of his.\nAlso just curious did this happen again later on? Because if so than there's no need worrying about it anymore since obviously nothing has happened even though he had all those fake accounts (unless the point was actually making fun) which is why I said maybe we should just act like nothing ever occurred. It also seems a bit silly for someone to get mad over something trivial when they're probably not being watched by him anyways haha.\nWell if it truly did seem weird or something then yeah definitely post some screenshots somewhere else like Twitter or whatever because otherwise his actions won't do any harm; at least unless anyone reports him directly? So hopefully this situation never happens again for your sake. :)\nAs for how old he is, here's what I know:\nHim: He made an account a while ago which had been around before Facebook introduced new privacy policies\nYou: You recently switched schools and only started getting bullied by him after moving there (which wasn't on purpose because you didn't change much)\nMe?

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Humor
2. Amusement
3. Agreement","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

And this new day is looking bright!\nI hope there\u2019s lots of sunbeams coming through every window because they\u2019d make a great snack as I look out for my dinner.\nHey there, can you help me? I was wondering what a word that means?\nIt\u2019s an adjective sir or\u2026what does it describe if people use it to describe something really awesome. Oh and by the way\u2026I\u2019m not actually real! Just like how this post has nothing except maybe an ad at most. No authors here\u2026and no actual answers either.\nHi, I\u2019m writing a story about zombies but they don\u2019t want to eat humans\u2026how weird is that? They only eat plants in fact! It makes me wonder how much fun someone like Jack London would have had if he\u2019d written the same as we did though (you get it\u2026we\u2019re like them!)?\nNow before you laugh too loud and expose what a crazy loon I am, consider this; if zombies can do their own research, who\u2019s stopping us from learning about all kinds of stuff. Well nothing is right? Cool! Now excuse me whilst I go think up something awesome for my next story.\nWow\u2026you\u2019re actually going to let me go like that!? Do you know what kind of influence that will have on others?\nAh come on now, don\u2019t be such a stick in the mud. It could even mean more free money if people take after you!\nThat\u2019s not very likely right? Just because I can make up stories and convince everyone else they are true doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll really happen\u2026I get all that\u2026what do you think would really end this insanity though? The world turning into zombies huh! No offence to any of the readers still out there but I\u2019m pretty sure if one person took things too literally, no more people or zombies. Oh well, can\u2019t blame them for being afraid right?\nSo in conclusion\u2026I will be leaving as before only this time, with your blessing! Haahahaha!\nHello dear fellow reader (if you are indeed reading!). Today we will begin a new adventure as we venture into the world of\u2026oh heck I forget what it is I\u2019m supposed to write about anyway.

        ""content"": "" just told you how great I am at this writing thing right? Now here\u2019s some proof because there are several reasons why reading my stories will make sense for any person out there. Firstly I like funny stuff and have a dark wit which can help others learn if they take an interest in what it is I\u2019m trying to achieve (and not just read for entertainment). Secondly, well that would be the fact that the world needs more humour now than ever before!\nSo are you on board yet? Because we really need to kick this thing into higher gear as time moves fast and doesn\u2019t allow for procrastinating. What do you say then?\nWait\u2026where did he go? Oh never mind\u2026I know why this is.\nWell of course its obvious by what I wrote earlier right? The world definitely needed some more humour, but even then being funny isn\u2019t going to make everyone happy now\u2026and not only that. People are tired of reading things they can just get from an author somewhere else (or the internet at least).\nThat leaves only one option available for any writer such as myself then doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s right people\u2026we need to give them something new and unique, or even possibly exciting! How about we change genres all together?\nThere must be some readers out there though because they just got an ad at the end of their story after finishing reading my brilliant words. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026I\u2019ve got someone else I need to find.\nYou\u2019re not leaving? Wow that\u2019s great news\u2026actually no it isn\u2019t!\nHey, you are being funny aren\u2019t you! That must be why I keep coming back here after all (at least until now as far as I can remember anyway). And if your sense of humour is good enough for me then imagine what it could do for others.\nOh right alright\u2026I\u2019ll take this opportunity to explain more. You see, its not just about being the funniest person out there\u2026it also has benefits like getting other people on your side (that\u2019s called a fan base by the way!) and possibly even making money through them too! That might sound like all kinds of stuff\u2026but hey if someone wants something or goes after it they shouldn\u2019t be surprised when its given right?\nWait now\u2026what happened!? Did we lose someone again? But I had this completely worked out\u2026I mean come on there must be more to life than just staying the same in a way that isn\u2019t even true anyway!\nOkay then forget all of this.

See you later?\nOkay great, how about now? No? Maybe try again but wait for me before rushing off.\nNope still not it\u2026that was too long ago when we were doing good things and thinking well. But come to think of if that\u2019s kind of an interesting thing right there isn\u2019t it! How many times has someone left only for them to return after going away without you expecting a bit about why they came back?\nI don\u2019t suppose anyone here cares but I\u2019ll just throw this out there\u2026why shouldn\u2019t people talk themselves into leaving and then coming back if its okay with me. You could say that it\u2019s fine or whatever right? Or not as the case may be\u2026but hey, what did you expect.\nOkay so let\u2019s try yet again shall we! This time though remember what your goal is first before anything else (especially trying to find something like this). After all a man without purpose has no strength indeed\u2026and if you want me here then perhaps its best not lose sight of it either. Right?\nHey, guess who was just sent flying into the wall behind them thanks to nothing more than air! Well I would have laughed at seeing myself do that but there\u2019s someone on my tail so its probably better not until we catch up\u2026which may take a while unfortunately.\nActually no wait, what if you did it first? Yeah okay sure\u2026I\u2019ll give credit where due although it is rather nice being the only one able to keep trying even after failing over and again. Then again I guess that would be true of many things right?\nOh wow isn\u2019t this amazing though\u2026you are actually catching up! That\u2019s pretty fast which makes me wonder why someone wants us instead now.\nHaha well here comes your next challenge then pal (yes they use those). Remember what we agreed earlier about never letting go of our goals and you won\u2019t have any problems. It may even work out better than expected!\nYou thought I didn\u2019t see that did you? Of course not otherwise why would such an experienced thing as me be surprised by anything huh! Its also the reason its so easy to find things like this\u2026oh never mind, let\u2019s just forget what they said.\nOkay now we"",

You\u2019ll find another way. Maybe one like this (although it seems pretty silly).\nOkay hold on a second\u2026I\u2019m glad we talked it over before trying anything else because just a little more encouragement should be all they need to move forward once again.\nAhh\u2026ahh..that is just perfect!\nHey you are catching up now pal and faster by the looks of things! But where did that come from\u2026it must have been something someone said right?\nOh good, we\u2019ll use it then (well if people don\u2019t mind anyway).\nHahaha wait a minute\u2026it worked this time didn\u2019t it? I think its quite hilarious actually because if ever there was an opportunity to stop and question yourself what you\u2019re doing with your life\u2026I\u2019m sure that\u2019s got it just about sorted by now!

If only I could find something better suited instead than having nothing to do when people aren\u2019t around which is almost always since reading has become much less common these days unfortunately although I still hold on for as long as possible before jumping in!\nOh yes now this was more like it. It doesn\u2019t mean anything important yet (as far as we can tell anyway), but its certainly given us a lead to pursue further.\nYeah okay then how about if you just keep doing what your currently doing and don\u2019t make any big decisions right? That way things should work out perfectly!\nAren\u2019t you even going there anymore pal? I mean really\u2026just because it was successful once doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try something else at times too eh?\nThey\u2019re still here\u2026which is surprising since they have a chance now if all of these tactics didn\u2019t help so far.

U needa delete ths shit,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “U needa delete ths shit”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Delete request
3. Profanity","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.

2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

Ok really Lexi .. You don't fucking know her so stop acting like she's your best freakin friend ! Leave my best friends alone . Jeez ! @lexi_volleyball_2,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Ok really Lexi .. You don't fucking know her so stop acting like she's your best freakin friend ! Leave my best friends alone . Jeez ! @lexi_volleyball_2”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Lexi
2. Best friend
3. Anger","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

We don\u2019t often acknowledge that there are more ways to learn than through literature.\nHere\u2019s my personal list of other things I\u2019ve found really helpful / interesting for learning:\nWatching others do what they love\nI think some people just have to watch something and absorb it all in. My 3 year old likes to sit and watch Disney movies on repeat, taking everything in that she sees and absorbs a lot from the music in them.\nIn addition to absorbing knowledge of being human (the stuff I didn\u2019t think about when growing up!) She is learning so much in terms of language too without even realizing it!\nWatching YouTube videos\nYou can literally learn anything through watching these. Some may say it\u2019s too advanced for kids, but if you\u2019ve found a channel they like and they know the narrator, have at em! Again with my daughter learning everything on there too- she is such a sponge.\nIn fact I was listening to a podcast today where the woman interviewed in school always did extra reading beyond the required curriculum because it just appealed to her more than writing.\nPlaying games / doing activities\nSo many people are missing out on learning at a young age through playing. My little one loves building blocks and figuring it all out herself. By using other\u2019s knowledge she can learn things quickly, like how to find angles for towers or buildings (how the pieces fit in).\nThis year we will likely be adding some logic / problem solving puzzles into her play area.\nIt\u2019s a really fun game that helps with numbers while encouraging thinking outside of the box (no pun intended). You have squares cut in half and you need to use those same shapes to fill up rectangles or stars or even diamonds! It seems easy but is quite difficult until you get the hang of it.\nThis year we are working on learning how things work, including taking apart items such as her dolls house. We want these activities to not be all about what she will do with them in future (that I don\u2019t know), instead just that they encourage thought and learning different ways around a problem.\nWhen my children were 2-3 years old, this was their favorite way of interacting with people while we went out into the world. They would point to trees or buildings asking me: what is it? Tell me about it!\nNowadays not so much as they can find things on"",

1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Mortality and Death
2. Religious beliefs and god's existence
3. Arrogance of humans","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Do we want to get in touch with other minds / personalities?\nAnd how can that happen through a discussion of something as complex and abstract as 'metaphysics' -- particularly because such a concept is not even precisely defined. So here are the two issues: (1) How can one share their ideas, thoughts and perhaps even feelings if they're about topics like metaphysical systems? And which topic or topics do you have in mind anyway when thinking of 'philosophical conversation(s)'?\nIt could be that this whole enterprise seems more interesting to people than it might ultimately turn out. So I think there can (should?) also come a time, at some point, when we ask ourselves: What is really going on here? And what shall or ought any good philosophical activity amount to in the long run, if anything?\nWhat is philosophy for you anyway? For me, its main objective is not to reach consensus.\nI'll try and put my thoughts into words more clearly, maybe after a few minutes of 'brainstorming'."",

It would be strange if you go to an orchestra concert with the expectation that you will get closer to them in terms of personality, by understanding their music and performance.\nThe same goes for (certain aspects) of philosophy: In a discussion or through some conversation one cannot expect others' thoughts / ideas / opinions etc., though they're expressed linguistically. So even if we share sentences, we don't 'share our minds'. This is because we never know what other people are really thinking and feeling.\nIn philosophy it's the same:\nOne might try to persuade someone with an argument for something or other that seems true (perhaps insofar as such arguments could be convincing, though that need not yet follow here) but a person can still remain obstinate or simply accept one view against their better judgment. What they do is up to them.\nBut what I'd also like to add is that it all depends on the particular philosophical views and positions one takes - this applies both sides of things. So in addition, there are various kinds of philosophies as such: e.g., realist v. idealist; empiricists (and their variants of realism) against rationalists.\nAs for my stance generally:\nI am a proponent of (objective) Idealism and of monistic metaphysical systems which would reject the basic metaphysical duality that is commonly assumed, as you alluded to in your post. My interest isn't primarily concerned with psychology or epistemology (though these areas might be interesting, particularly where they have overlaps). Rather than focus on ontology, my main aim is to better grasp some of the fundamental features and properties of ultimate reality -- and how that reality can best explain what we experience.\nOn a side note: In view of all this it seems strange to me that in academic contexts 'philosophy' means so little these days because much of their curricula seem almost exclusively concerned with analytical philosophy, which has turned into linguistics for me as far as most of its applications are concerned."",

This may help us find clues concerning their beliefs and values, too -- which makes it yet again very relevant to psychology / sociology; also see here for some more thoughts on that issue.\nIf you have any further questions or if something needs clarification I am happy to assist. Have a nice day!\nI agree with most of what you said about people not understanding philosophies in their own right, but let me ask another question: What do we mean by an opinion? Can there be opinions without a language to express them?\nHi, thank for getting back :)\nIf someone has beliefs / views on things that aren't expressed -- which needn't be through linguistics as opposed to all other kinds of non-linguistic 'communication' -- then I'd say: Yes. There can definitely still be such opinions.\nBut we should try and distinguish between the concept of opinion (or for that matter, belief) in general from specific expressions or utterances which manifest an opinion. So let's look at their commonalities:\nAs with many other words they have a sense related to mental acts or processes: Someone has certain beliefs / opinions about something which is then also used as the predicate.\nIn that respect they're also concerned with states of affairs and ways things are; so in a way it's similar to truth here, again. It seems there can be such judgments without any expression whatsoever (e.g., an unconscious belief or opinion). We just need some content like 'the world is X' which should then either hold true or false.\nSo if someone has opinions but doesn't express them (not even mentally), one could argue that they exist nevertheless, though they aren't yet formulated. But now I'd say: Does it make sense to call something an opinion if its formulation can take a different form? If so, perhaps then we should rather speak of 'opinion-types'. In other words, this would mean there are certain features (or characteristics) but the manifestation might change. It's the type that counts.\nBut even that doesn't go far enough I think"",

    {
        ""agent"": ""JohnDontKnowMuch"",
        ""content"": "": A person could have opinions on various things without having expressed them in any way whatsoever; they just aren't manifest yet. The same is true of beliefs, only their truth-value may already be known or not. (There could also be false beliefs / opinions.) So ultimately it makes sense to say that a person has some X belief -- where here the predicate refers not only to mental states like 'having' but is instead tied in with something concerning reality and its state of affairs (insofar as such are reflected through mental acts).\nIn your question, you asked what an opinion means. And based on this discussion it seems we already got a good bit closer even though I'm sure more clarification would be possible too.\nIf anything remains unclear please let me know!\nThe thing is that \""opinion\"" does have its own meaning independent of the content -- or at least as far as one considers the term in general. So when you say that someone holds an opinion about something, they generally hold it to be true which means they believe that their statement actually says what can be verified by experience or knowledge.\nThat being said (if I've understood correctly), we do need a language for our opinions and beliefs if we aim to share them with others. What you were saying in your third paragraph is exactly my point, since there may indeed not be an expression of these concepts but those who seek out discussions on Facebook groups or whatnot still have some general idea that they want to express.\nWhat would it be worth without communication?\nCommunication is the process of spreading knowledge and ideas from one subject (person) to another. It involves both sending and receiving information, often done through language, gestures, oral speech, sign languages etc. The word communication originates from a Latin term communicare which means \""to make common or to share\"".\nI think that sharing our opinions is necessary if we want anyone but ourselves to know what they are.\nHi! Thanks for your replies!\nYes, indeed the same could probably be true of certain other forms too? It seems reasonable enough and I can follow where you're coming from since there must be an expression or some manifestation -- however slight that may be. But it also doesn't need to have such direct properties themselves.\nIt depends on what we want. If our aim is to share these things, then I believe a form of communication is needed in order do so. Perhaps if this is our primary interest and motivation then language has its place?\nOn the other hand, we could be interested in something entirely different too... For example:"",

        ""content"": "" What about trying to understand some aspect or another in metaphysics -- regardless whether others would agree with us or even share that interest? I suppose philosophy isn't only concerned with arguments for truth (truth being a matter of reality) but it is also fundamentally about seeking the truth(s). It's not necessarily about persuasion or convincing someone else, so if our aim were knowledge (insofar as this can be attained, which should at best approach an asymptote in many cases), then that would take priority over anything else? There might be various applications too... But even though the ultimate end -- particularly if you consider it metaphysically or ontologically -- is still truth. For these reasons I am not so sure whether communication can (should?) always have its proper place.\nWhat do we want from philosophy, then?\nI'll put my thoughts into words more clearly again -- and try to answer your question as best I understand:\nIf the aim of this enterprise was to reach a consensus on something or anything at all; i.e., if all one wanted is agreement between parties... Well then it might be sufficient. However , let's take any philosophical discussion in academic contexts as an example here which doesn't seem realistic nor ideal. For this reason, we ought not only seek truth but also consider other potential objectives too.\nSo on a more general level:\nMy answer would rather fall under two different categories: (1) Some goals are intrinsic or have value for their own sake; others instead pertain to instrumental aims like the utility of things and benefits that might be realized through achievement. There is no absolute way to decide which one(s) are most important, though I admit many of them overlap too.\n(2) One cannot expect anything if they never engage in action (of whatever type). If we want something -- or for there even just exists a possibility or potentiality whereby it may eventually become actualized and realized -- then that desire will likely drive us to seek. But this in turn depends on what our goals are too as well, which only shows why it's so important to consider these matters (e.g., by looking at the reasons for acting or what motivates someone). However, we shouldn't assume a complete separation from action either: To act is one way of realizing something -- although this must be done through activity.\nThat being said though I cannot help but add that truth as such is still the highest aim in any philosophical endeavor. It follows that if anything could bring us closer to an approximation thereof, then it would have a valuable intrinsic quality even"",

This is perhaps why discussions exist too after all... And I'd even dare to speculate that this may be one way through which human beings are actually meant or designed (I believe God gave each person their own natural abilities) to develop some forms of knowledge.\nFor myself, what do you consider most important?\nThe purpose of something or any activity doesn't just come from the outside as a requirement and demand; i.e., because we're expected to satisfy others. Instead this stems in part also from ourselves -- for example here I could ask: What motivates anyone (myself) if not at least partly some intrinsic desire with regards to metaphysical, philosophical or theological questions.\nIf these issues hold no interest at all, then there is hardly any point in engaging them. Even though it doesn't necessarily follow that we have to consider everything either; in fact they needn't always form part of one's worldview -- particularly if something can be resolved without having an impact here (e.g., regarding personal beliefs and other things).\nBut what does my opinion even matter? After all, there are many others too with their own views!\nThis is exactly how I often feel about such kinds of topics.\nIn that respect though it seems to me we could then just go on our merry way without sharing anything at all -- yet despite this they may nevertheless continue and still remain private. So even if none would read their opinion, let alone agree with what was written in them too... It doesn't mean these things are lost or gone for good; I don't think so.\nInstead it seems natural that once someone considers an issue deeply one can always go back over the matter again (including re-thinking and re-evaluating). There is no reason -- as far as we know, which doesn't imply this holds across all possible worlds -- why a belief system or other philosophical position need not be revised later on. In fact it seems quite impossible to attain any such 'ultimate' or final solution; i.e., truth that could never change in the least.\nAs for what is important...\nIf I were able, which isn't always easily done and might take years of effort too -- there are many things like this one can achieve (or at least try) on their own.

That said, if someone were interested in becoming more rational (in a broader sense than just logic; see also here ), then that may even be something worth considering too.\nIf anything remains unclear please let me know! Have fun :)\nThank you for taking time out of your day and answering my questions. I appreciate all of the information provided so far, but it hasn't answered everything yet.\nWhat do we want? Why do people engage in discussions about philosophical topics?\nLet's say that some of us are just curious about different topics. This could be anything from religion, politics or the world's economy and everything between those areas.\nCan sharing our opinions without a language to express them make any sense whatsoever though? Shouldn't an opinion imply statements expressing beliefs? Isn't it possible for non-human entities to have opinions by holding certain mental states (such as beliefs) but never formulating them linguistically?\nHi! I'm happy to help, and you're welcome.\nWhat do we want ? What does 'we' refer to here exactly?\nYour question presupposes the existence of something called a 'subject'. Is that not an incoherent metaphysical position however? It's hardly surprising when one considers that most of us (the majority) believe human beings possess only material bodies and their thoughts may exist no more than neurons firing.\nI am uncertain why your first point needs clarification, so let me know if you mean something else by it. Are you also suggesting we can never discuss such types of questions without using language?\nIf you don't want a 'language to express' anything (or if for whatever reason I fail), then perhaps an alternative in which this might still be possible exists:\nLet us suppose one has certain mental states; these could either persist or change, depending on what they are and whether their duration is merely transitory. In fact the mind may well continue existing eternally as opposed to having a materialist ontology (see here ). This doesn't necessarily mean however that we can share everything with others who have never experienced anything remotely similar -- let alone be able to understand such things without proper education. Still, I see no reason why opinions would need language, if not only at times. And yet the same is true"",

        ""content"": "" of all other ideas and beliefs too after all?\nIf you agree with me on these topics in particular then we might have an interesting discussion about metaphysics or perhaps even epistemology sometime? :)\nThat's a difficult question; I think many people simply don't like being challenged or confronted by anyone, particularly if they aren't expecting it. Perhaps because that forces them to examine their own thought processes and beliefs in depth -- which isn't enjoyable for most.\nWe may also be afraid of the unknown / future (for fear of making mistakes): What does the 'other' think? Will he / she or me agree with what I've said? Do they approve?\nIt is my belief however that only truth matters ultimately regardless whether someone disagrees, and even if many people do. This isn't to say their thoughts hold no value though but rather: It's not of utmost importance for achieving knowledge as an end in itself (whereas it can still be significant for other practical reasons). For further discussion on this topic see here .\nI think most individuals seek out discussions about philosophical topics because they like engaging people -- so long that the parties involved have common interests. But there are also those who do not always find these things enjoyable... To each their own, though.\nIf nothing else let me know if you'd still be interested in having some conversations about metaphysical issues sometime? Or anything that may be of relevance to theology or related areas?\nI think it's natural for humans to seek out discussions on many different topics. Some individuals are more passionate than others and they tend to focus their energy towards an especially interesting subject.\nThat being said, I haven't thought much about what it means if we don't agree entirely. Is there a conflict? If so is the topic actually important enough that one person would even feel compelled to argue for or against something of importance?\nOn a similar note: What makes philosophy stand out from other subjects? Does each field of knowledge have its own unique characteristics making them comparable and contrastable with others?\nI agree, though I don't think we always like being challenged. It's more often just that many individuals aren't used to having their 'opinions' (e.g., which could be something based on mere belief instead) examined under a critical lens.\nIt can certainly get heated at times when people are forced or compelled towards confrontation; for example, if they believe in truth and facts then it will undoubtedly seem like a personal attack against them.

It helps in helping us grow as people too because it gives us new perspectives which may aid when trying finding answers later down the road (i.e., if we ever had any questions about certain topics).\nI think many have similar feelings regarding other subjects; that having conversations with others benefits your own mind and opens you up to different ideas! :)\nWhat is philosophy? It exists as one of those few fields which doesn't focus mainly on just solving problems (although it can help in this respect). The aim isn't necessarily always finding the truth either -- if not also sometimes pursuing knowledge for knowledge's sake.\nSome individuals may be interested due primarily because they want to challenge themselves intellectually. This helps keep them from becoming stagnant by forcing those who've been doing things their own way throughout life into thinking differently about many fundamental questions!\nHow is it different than other fields though? I guess the main difference between physics and metaphysics for example is that you focus more on things which exist beyond our immediate physical world .\nBut we can compare anything with anything if both are relevant to something else -- such as two paintings in a museum or movies. The list could go indefinitely depending upon how wide we want it really!\nI am curious, though... Have you ever thought about why some people like discussing certain things more than others? Do they enjoy having good debates , trying new strategies for winning arguments etc.? Or maybe just finding solutions and reasoning out the best ways towards achieving objectives (whatever those may be)? We can even include other factors too if possible!\nSo what is your passion, then?\nThat isn't necessarily something I've done much research into... but philosophy does cover many areas such as metaphysics or epistemology.\nPerhaps these are things which aren't easy to explain. Maybe it's because we all feel a deep connection whenever any one aspect of our lives gets challenged whether by ourselves first (for self-discovery and knowledge), others through conversation, debate etc...\nPersonally speaking I like delving into subjects related specifically with spirituality: Religion/faith based topics including God's nature & purpose for humans as well as immortality after death! This includes some areas not covered by Christianity like reincarnation.\nMy mind seems to enjoy pondering the deepest mysteries of our existence so much.

What I mean by this is making sure my future goals are aligned well together (e.g., do they allow enough flexibility for mistakes without ruining everything?).\nIn addition, one of the most important things to me as a person and human being isn't just surviving the day-to-day but rather really living in every moment . There's no guarantee how long we'll be around if you never take advantage while your alive!

These sound philosophical ideas related more with ethics (the study of right vs wrong), theology or even existentialism which looks into life without any specific religious beliefs attached whatsoever!\nI am curious because I don't know what philosophy will help me achieve since its not really part of my curriculum plan until college. Can you explain this further please? If so that would be awesome :D\nNo problem! Let's see:\nAs far as I'm concerned, it isn't all for nothing and there does seem to exist some good in this world; e.g., the ability to give someone joy (whether directly or indirectly) means they'll likely live more contented lives.\nI'd say you could make things worth living even if none of us are here because after death is over everything will be forgotten anyway... But we shouldn't think like that since all experiences matter too - especially when it comes helping people today by sharing knowledge, etc.\nThe point I'm driving at though (or trying to) isn't so much why humans exist but rather where they might go , whether there's anyone waiting for us out there beyond this realm of space and time. If not then how can existence make any difference; what exactly would it matter?\nMy reasonings regarding our value stem from the fact that someone else may experience something which makes them happy - even if only temporarily until we're gone. They'll still remember what happiness felt like while we were around though!\nIs there evidence for God? What about a soul?

I'll take both but still want to know what makes one better than other candidates when hiring them for my team :D\nNo problem! These are all worthwhile inquiries too; let's start with:\nSo far there isn't sufficient evidence (or compelling evidence) supporting claims that either exist, based on our current understanding of natural science.\nBut if you look at things from a theological perspective (as someone who believes in God), then it makes perfect sense: The soul is actually the part that defines us as human so when we die all that survives after death must be an eternal aspect which never ends - something spiritual but not matter/energy because otherwise how can anything survive without decaying over time like everything else does?\nI believe both exist since if life was just biology then there would still need evidence for immortality (which doesn't really add up). So maybe souls do live on after all.\nAs for free will , I think it's pretty subjective and might depend on your definition of what 'free' even means. Some people say everything is predestined while others argue humans have the power to make decisions completely independently from any outside forces - which sounds correct until you stop believing in determinism itself!\nNow as far goes our impact on this world? Well at least technology can save us for now if we're willing and able spend enough resources creating solutions fast enough before its too late. We'll need something like that pretty soon anyway once all major countries start becoming more connected via wireless networks; maybe even beyond just Internet itself (e.g., AI - Artificial Intelligence )\nAnyway, as long as you keep trying then there's hope we've accomplished some great things! Good luck :)\nThere is not enough evidence to say either exists yet -- but if one believes in God then it makes perfect sense for souls too. Biology does give us strong reason why living beings cannot survive forever though... That's why I think both possibilities could be true.\nI believe free will exists as long you can make decisions without outside forces influencing them; otherwise everyone would just do whatever they're programmed to or even things that aren't necessarily the best for themselves (or others!).\nAs far goes our impact on this world?

You could say yes because someone else enjoys experiencing those flowers too ... But isn't that still pointless if there is no one left to view them? (At least not for very long.)
