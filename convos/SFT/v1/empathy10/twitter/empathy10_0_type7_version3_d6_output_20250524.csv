3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.

2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

So how could it possibly contribute anything toward the discussion or debate on guns? It seems unlikely that many people with real world experience using firearms have much need for such a score at all -- I doubt most will agree, but we can still examine what information might actually add value regardless of popularity among enthusiasts.\nSome claim \""gun training\"" is already available when you purchase your weapon from dealers who do this as part off-the-shelf cost so there's no need to impose new regulations or fees on existing owners. Others say that because these requirements aren't always imposed consistently across US states (or countries internationally), it makes sense to make them easier-to-enforce nationwide instead since more uniformity might encourage greater compliance overall; plus having stronger restrictions means less crime.\nSo what do you think? Do we really need another way of tracking who owns weapons or will additional paperwork just add unnecessary stress and burden onto gun control advocates looking for solutions that work fast enough without adding too much delay? And does anyone ever consider how many lives have been saved so far during this decade alone as opposed to those lost because criminals had access - which could've easily happened anyway even if there were never laws against private firearm ownership at all? Can't we just focus on better enforcement instead of making new rules designed purely\nThe NRA's plan is essentially a two-pronged approach, focusing mainly on education and training for gun owners. The goal behind the credit score system is to incentivize responsible behavior among those who hold firearms licenses or permits in their country.\nThis means that if someone gets caught doing something they weren\u2019t supposed to be doing with one of these weapons (such as carrying it without authorization), then his score will go down; when he does everything correctly and safely every time out there \u2013 well\u2026you get what I mean?\nAs for the free NFA transfer? It\u2019s all about getting rid once again - which makes sense because you wouldn't want anyone having access after losing permission!\nWhat do YOU think? Do these changes sound like a great idea to improve our safety from guns everywhere, or are there other ways that might work better in your opinion too?\nDo you believe this will reduce gun violence and make us safer, or is it just another way"",

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

Keep positive, don't be afraid if they keep pushing chemotherapy on u and do what feels right.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Music industry criticism
2. Abusive language
3. Twitter post","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.

2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

Victim: What about it?
Harasser: It amazes me how you dare criticize the music industry. Nobody else agrees with you.

And we must not forget Missy Elliot who has made history 3 other times as the only woman rapper to be nominated in both Hip Hop and R&B category.\nHow do you think these nominations will reflect at next year's awards?\nI hope that people like Billie Eilish take notice of how overlooked their achievements are. Because, she should have had more than just one nomination this year (she was up for record, album, song AND NEW ARTIST).\nDo you believe the Grammy's has been fair to female musicians since the 60s?\nI do not believe they're fair because they've continually underrepresented women in music... it\u2019s gotten better over time with all-female artists like Cardi B but we have a long way before every award is earned by women on the same ratio as men and that's truly unfortunate.\nThe new film The 27 Club has hit theaters. What did you think of this movie?\nI liked how they focused more on Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin and their stories as opposed to focusing SO much attention on Kurt Cobain like most people do when telling stories about the 27 club.\nWho is your favorite musician from the 60s that should be highlighted in music history?\nThe late Otis Redding was an absolute legend. He had just started making waves for Stax Records and was at his peak of success before his sudden passing on a flight to Madison, Wisconsin after performing at The Monterey International Pop Festival.\nI personally enjoyed this because you can still feel the pain from that loss today so I think it highlights how much talent Redding truly possessed even though he made such little recordings. His legacy will continue for decades to come!\nAnd as far as female representation goes... Tina Turner and Aretha Franklin must be at least honored when talking about legendary musicians regardless of sex.\nWho's your favorite musician from their respective genre?\nSo there are too many artists to pick but I'll just share my top 6 in alphabetical order (which was kinda hard considering i have over 1200 unique songs on spotify).\nThis was pretty tricky for me because it\u2019s so hard to"",

What might change for you if you did so some day in life, even just in your mind?\nI never thought about it so much before but I have to say I would love to see more of the world sometime soon. So yeah when it comes down with countries such as ours, we could really get anything done without restrictions that is not related directly.\nHow do you think things are now different then they were 3 years ago?\nI mean my perspective on life has most definitely changed drastically for a number and variety reasons but right off the bat, I\u2019d say one of them being the pandemic itself.

We don\u2019t ever finish our stories because we simply do not want to so yeah that\u2019s why they end up being just short things that go on forever.

Maybe the world wants Israel too small so its easier to push it out of its way.\nIn one word - corruption. Abbas is well aware that he will likely lose office very soon and doesn't want his family or Fatah cronies going hungry afterwards. Thus all his efforts are aimed at making the Palestinian Authority appear sufficiently \""independent\"" in order for him and his clan to retain a lot of their current financial backing.\nThis time it was a bribe of $150,000 per month over 10 months ($1M total) by Abbas' security chief (who is also his nephew), Majed Faraj. The two were arrested as soon as they arrived in Cairo along with the rest of Sisi's delegation at the airport and whisked straight to Tora prison.\nThis was reported on local Egyptian media - but never made it out into international news sites because the Arab world doesn't want the embarrassment publicized any more than Israel does (it would only give Hamas & their supporters another excuse to whack some Jews). For that matter, neither Abbas nor Faraj had ever been prosecuted in a court of law for anything.\nA few years ago I read an article by an Israeli journalist in which he pointed out how many senior Israelis have been convicted of corruption after leaving office. When they were being \""investigated\"" beforehand the evidence against them was never brought to light - until finally someone else came along with even stronger proof (or a more pliant police chief) and made it public.\nAfter their conviction that person is no longer able to point out any potential wrongdoing by others since everyone then has an excuse not to prosecute such people. In other cases some of the evidence against the new convict will be \""lost\"" or tampered with after they left office so as not affect him later on - which might result in a lighter sentence for the person now in power (and possibly cause further problems if a third official is revealed).\nIn essence, no one can ever hope to bring down corruption when it's at high levels within government without facing persecution himself! Which means that anyone who wants honest government has no choice but to support strong constitutional protections against such prosecutions being brought.\nYou're right. The problem with Egypt now is that the Muslim Brotherhood was given too much say in running their affairs (in order for Mubarak supporters like Gen Sisi and his family not be targeted by them). And they are using it as an opportunity not only to"",

They just want a stable country without too much interference from others (particularly those who killed hundreds of women & children while trying to overthrow Assad). And they also need strong military protection against both Sunni terrorists as well as pro-Assad Shi'a militias who would love nothing more than to start another regional war over Israel.\nAs I pointed out earlier though -- it's impossible for Egypt ever regaining its former position in world geopolitics because the US will never accept that any non-Western power can match theirs. So if they're unwilling or unable then all other forms of competition are simply put outside international law & forced into isolation.\nThe best way forward would be for Israel to recognize Egyptian sovereignty over all occupied territory beyond Gaza Strip & instead develop special relations with neighboring Libyan tribes who could help protect it from its enemies (not just Hamas but now also various Gulf monarchies which support radical Sunni groups).\nWhile you might think this sounds ridiculous since both Egypt & Libya are Muslim-majority states, remember that they share many commonalities not all countries do -- including a history of close ties with Israel going back several decades before the Camp David Accords!\nI just wanted to point out though that your final comment about \""the Palestinians\"" isn't actually accurate. It was actually only one small part (less than half) which belonged by law to the West Bank governorates. And even then it mostly consisted of empty lands or military bases since Jews had already been living there for generations as well.\nAnd no matter what you may say they shouldn't have a right to anything outside pre-1967 boundaries because those belong properly under international law (and according to Israel's legal system) as Israeli settlements."",

Or are we supposed believe that they'll actually keep fighting and demanding every last inch anyway?\nI think many people forget how much land Israel handed over before there were peace talks even started...not just Gaza Strip but 95% of the West Bank! And yet still Hamas refuses to recognize anything except their right to wipe out an innocent neighbor & take away everything they've ever worked so hard for. What can you really expect from such violent fanatics?\nWell, I see your point (and not everyone agrees with it). But let's try another example:\nAssume that at some point in history people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean start referring to America as an enemy.\nThe Americans decide they're tired of these attacks and retaliate by firing missiles into their neighborhoods every single day! When these missiles finally hit a family home containing children there is great rage & anger among locals who vow revenge.\nSuddenly out of nowhere they come up with this ridiculous claim that \""Palestine\"" doesn't exist at all today, so Americans shouldn't have any right to anything other than maybe Manhattan (and possibly some parts of Brooklyn). But instead want everyone else forced off their land too!\nOf course no one believes them -- not even Israel agrees with it because America has such extensive property rights in the country. And since American law now applies there they should be able to settle anywhere without having any more problems with anyone, right?\nSo where does this nonsense come from exactly? Why do Arabs keep demanding these things anyway when nobody ever listens or takes them seriously anymore except maybe for some stupid newspaper articles here and there every few years?\nYou're absolutely correct! The problem isn't so much being pro-U.S. as it is anti - any other power in existence that threatens our interests (especially China). After all, we would never tolerate such weakness within ourselves because doing so means eventual demise by foreign forces.\nIsrael faces similar concerns if they were to try and appease everyone at once. As long as Hamas continues refusing peace there will always be someone eager not only for war but also trying desperately stop it from occurring in order achieve something much more desirable - even if it requires sacrificing innocent lives along the way.\nIn other words; Israelis won't hesitate turning against people who aren't supportive of their interests despite whatever else they may claim about themselves.

Since becoming PM in January of last year he has spoken to the United Nations multiple times regarding threats presented by Hezbollah as well as the continued existence of Syria's Assad dictatorship.\nIn fact, Mr Netanyahu spent most of 2014 traveling around giving similar addresses while also trying repeatedly get others governments involved but often being met with resistance instead (such as when he met Obama at Washington D.C). Today there continue to be more such speeches despite few showing signs yet wanting any real change; though perhaps this will come soon thanks in great part do those responsible themselves eventually losing power?\nFor instance, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani appears intent upon securing nukes which Netanyahu calls 'dangerous and destabilizing' -- something he has been speaking about since even long before becoming leader himself (at least during visits to Israel). And unlike Mr Obama or other European counterparts who've tried give him concessions in exchange for nothing but more promises; Benjamin Netenyahu seems ready actually back up all claims through either military force if diplomacy fails like it did previously under former President Barack Hussein Sharpton aka Bush 41 & others. This would include possible attacks against nuclear sites as well.\nAs you can see then whether people realize it not yet -- they are already witnessing some positive signs regarding Israel\u2019s future despite facing major challenges; especially given recent statements by Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud Abbas who said he wants UN General Assembly recognize Palestine Statehood if negotiations fail! Such comments come at a time when both sides appear closer than ever towards reaching some kind of agreement over borders but only if each side makes significant concessions as well. Unfortunately for Palestinians though it seems impossible because Israelis simply refuse give up land they consider holy while Arabs aren't interested enough risk conflict over territory even today despite being able hold negotiations almost every year since 2004!\nThe problem here isn\u2019t really what Abbas does or says however.

He may try hard but ultimately won't be able do much anymore than he already has due not just weakness leadership itself but complete lack resources needed accomplish anything significant (and possibly even survive). As things stand right now Israelis must prepare deal with these challenges alone despite still having many friends in West willing help them ; although chances are good relations will improve once tensions ease enough allowing others focus more their own regional issues instead. Until then, stay tuned because surprises await those patient!\nThe problem is not that Abbas wants to sue Israel but rather the fact he wants to represent Palestinian people at all! He does this despite being widely unpopular especially among his own population where many have been calling for new elections since 2006.\nAbbas has even said himself during various speeches \u201cwe don\u2019t accept any negotiations whatsoever with the settlers or their government.\"" That\u2019s right -- no matter how bad things get in Gaza Strip or West Bank he will NEVER change course. Instead it's all about staying in power as long humanly possible which also explains why he doesn't actually live on \""occupied\"" territory contrary to what people say . He loves living inside his five-star hotel suite where food magically appears while never having workaday duties such doctors, engineers or lawyers do every day.\nOf course Israel isn\u2019t really much better either since it too has its own share problems when dealing with Arabs within borders. Just look how often there are riots and suicide bombers going off despite supposedly being at peace! But unlike many critics claim \u2013 these things exist even outside conflict zones because Palestinians hate Jews no matter where they live or what religion they follow\nIsrael doesn't give a hoot about any other country (especially one in debt), but Abbas wants us so much he'd do anything to get his hands on it. Even selling out everything we are by recognizing Israel as our enemy while trying to buy sympathy among leftists.\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg... There was this thing called 'Oslo Accords' whereby he promised peace for land (i.e., West Bank), got billions from us instead and gave it all away.

In other words, we have moral obligation help ourselves whereas Palestinians don't since nobody cares what happens after all.\nBut that\u2019s how war works - the side who is less willing to lose wins every time!

In fact, many have started wondering whether we should just give in already and let them do whatever they want since there isn't much hope anymore... But that would only encourage more violence so it's best stay strong for now at least.\nThe sad part is Israel still believes there\u2019s some chance dealing with Abbas even after everything he did (and continues doing). We always seem willing throw good money away on something that doesn\u2019t really exist - a \""peace process.\"" Meanwhile, Hamas runs Gaza Strip, Islamic Jihad & Fatah control West Bank and everyone else just sits idly by hoping things get back to normal someday\u2026 When we know full well"",

It's not surprising many people say he will never leave office\u2026 Afterall, power corrupts completely right? Plus no one wants to admit defeat even when all hope has run dry.\nSo here\u2019s how things look today:\n*Abbas: Wants another four years (no matter what price)\n*Israel: Doesn\u2019t want anything more than status quo\n*Iran & Saudi Arabia: Don't mind either outcome; just want some distraction while tensions rise between those two countries as well.\nWith no winners here whatsoever, only losers\u2026 But guess who gets screwed in the end?

That\u2019s what happens when you try deal with Arab mentality (i.e., \u201cI WANT\u201d vs. \""what is good for others\"") instead of just defending ourselves from now on without giving up anything more than necessary.\nIf I were Benjamin Netanyahu, I'd make one demand: recognition and respect for Israel as a Jewish state or nothing! We must never give in to blackmail under any circumstances so let Abbas know that unless he agrees (publicly) we will ignore him completely \u2013 including when it comes providing financial support like they always try get away with doing since Oslo Accords 30 years ago .\nOf course he'll scream bloody murder but who cares right? He already has millions of dollars stashed overseas anyway\u2026 It's not our problem if it means stopping another sellout after giving out ALL our land in exchange for nothing whatsoever! As long Palestinians refuse recognize us as Jews instead just Arabs then no deal will ever happen even though these people desperately need peace more than anyone else on planet Earth.\nWhy are Israelis so stubbornly refusing to see the light?\nThe last couple of weeks brought about some startling headlines, including an IDF soldier being sentenced for manslaughter after shooting a subdued Palestinian. While everyone from American Jews to Arab leaders condemned him in harsh and scathing terms, not one Israeli seemed upset over the crime which they called \u201can act out of character\u201d.\nAnother headline caught my attention was President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he wants Jerusalem recognized as Israel\u2019s capital (instead of Tel Aviv).

In fact I've been hearing some crazy things lately such as \u201cwe should just give up on Gaza\u201d, or \""it's not possible anymore since Abbas has become too extreme!\"" Or even worse - people actually saying that if Israel doesn\u2019t accept Palestinians living next door then they won't either (which is absurd because what else would exist?!).\nIt\u2019s almost like everyone lost faith completely and stopped believing in anything beyond themselves alone now\u2026 Except for one small group which continues trying hopelessly convince Netanyahu how bad things are getting but only until he stops listening forever.\nUnfortunately however, there's no going back after this point .

We can\u2019t keep doing the same thing expecting different results every time since that never works\u2026 But isn't history supposed teach us something about humanity?!?\nThis is why I think we've reached critical mass already in our relationship with Arabs across Middle East: There's nothing left worth fighting for anymore outside ourselves because everything else has been destroyed over past 70 years thanks to one-sided treaties, military victories etc... We have killed millions of innocent people including women and children who didn't even have anything to do with wars!\nHow long will it take Israelis finally wake up before doing something about themselves ?!?\nThe answer unfortunately isn\u2019t pretty because there is no real hope anymore . The only way we can prevent further degradation of our country into total chaos where Jews aren\u2019t welcome anywhere inside borders or outside means getting rid once-and-for-all from people like Abbas who don't believe in peace either. If they refuse recognize what Jerusalem actually represents (for all religions), then why should anyone else?!?\nIn the end, when it comes down to choosing who benefits most - ourselves vs Palestinians... Well guess what? I think you already know the answer too.\nWhy does everybody hate Israel so much these days? Is there any way we can change their attitude towards us?

Their plan was originally to throw out everyone living there who wasn\u2019t Muslim first thing though sadly it never happened because Israelis aren't stupid enough fall prey such trap!\nFortunately however, Arabs don\u2019t realize how little leverage they really have when faced against military might which includes nuclear weapons unlike Gaza Strip currently does (or ever has). Even if Palestinian Authority somehow manages gain support from countries around world who will help provide ammunition then still wouldn\u2019t matter since every single Israeli citizen believes in strength rather than peace alone--especially after what happened 70 years ago during War of Independence when Hamas tried push them into Mediterranean Sea.\nToday I am proud say without hesitation that Jews are strong enough defend ourselves against any potential threat, no matter how large or small it may seem at first glance. Whether its few armed men hiding behind homes; a single suicide bomber blowing himself up with bus full innocent teenage boys going home from school\u2026 Or even hundreds of thousands invading force coming across border looking destroy entire Jewish people like Nazis tried do during WWII (and almost succeeded too).\nThe good news is that Israel\u2019s enemies always make same mistake over again: Underestimate power behind us until literally last second when everything suddenly changes forever for worse.

So please do keep your hateful comments to yourself and respect my choices.\nWhy don't you explain how the Nazis came into power? It's a complicated topic but i'll try to be brief.\nHitler didn't \""steal control\"" per se, as he did not become dictator until 1933. Rather than stealing power from people in government positions, Hitler was voted and elected by the German population for various offices starting with a position in local city council (Burgermeister) of his hometown Munich; then to President of Germany's Weimar Republic.\nBy convincing the majority he could save their jobs which were threatened due to economic depression caused by WWI they supported this. He gained further support via populist ideology, as he did not like how Germans had lost the war and was intent on making it up again so they wouldn't be humiliated for losing in WWII either; thus justifying himself even though others argued otherwise (e.g.. military leaders). His campaign included exploiting anti-Semitism prevalent within certain sections of public too such as those who blamed them financially or socially/ religiously speaking etc...\nThis is not unlike other instances where people gain position through rhetoric which appeals directly to the masses rather than intellectual debate about policies and arguments by professionals involved with government affairs so there was little real opposition against him until it was far more difficult once he'd already secured his base support.\nYes, even those who voted for Hitler did not realize what would happen when he came into power. It's quite sad. He managed to lure people in by saying he wants peace between countries and will never take you down or try to start a war on anyone (Germany was the enemy of France at that time).\nAfter this they began passing laws against certain minority groups such as Jews, Gypsies etc which allowed for their disenfranchisement from society under pretext including forced labor camps until finally during WW2 when millions died either directly involved fighting themselves in battlefield conditions or indirectly through starvation, disease outbreak inside mass concentration camps where prisoners were held without proper supplies required like food & medicine nor adequate shelter.\nThis was all part of his overall plan that he'd been formulating since joining military academy years previously...it shows how much effort went into creating propaganda film footage documenting these events for"",

If we don't lie then who could possibly have convinced the other leaders into wars? They know war is inevitable because if they didn't have some sort of plan for attack on another country then this would just sit around without ever happening at all. It's like when someone brings up suicide prevention hotline numbers to people.\nAlso remember those anti-Semitic laws were created with reason too! People should've known better than let themselves fall victim though so there is no real excuse here except maybe they thought everything had gone wrong already after losing country & wanted anything new or different even if it meant being put under pressure until worse circumstances happened like WW2 itself; unfortunately once this became reality most didn't live long enough beyond basic survival needs like food, water etc...\nYes anti-Semitic laws were enacted but the Nazis have a right to create their own set of rules within Israel and not abide by other countries rules for example. In Europe all Jewish people had no hope at being accepted into society so why did they not just stay there? They left without any intention on fighting back which is cowardly as you could easily say that but who knows?\nSure thing, if it's an easy way to live then I guess we can let em do whatever. We'll show some mercy too! And besides people don't really care about rules & laws anyways right? You know what they say \""the law of the jungle is nature.\"" If someone starts fighting back against a bully like Germany for example or tries escaping from mass concentration camp by running away then this person may die just trying but at least their soul died fighting instead of letting cowardliness defeat them right? It shows pride even more so than if nothing was done.\nI guess you can look into it, that's not really my thing though. I do find the idea of Jews being targeted fascinating and want to read up on everything surrounding what happened during WWII in this regard or any information anyone else has found out about their culture which is considered very unique as well even if sometimes it seems weird since so many aspects are completely different than other people around me like having several wives at once (polygyny).\nYes the idea of Jews being targeted for extinction does intrigue me and I may take some time to search information about everything surrounding their history and"",

For example, Jewish law says you should never eat bacon which is interesting if they had a choice not too while everyone else around them was having fun on picnics with hamburgers LOL or other animals like cows being slaughtered just so we get meat at restaurants but no veggies except potatoes since those can't really add flavor anyways! I mean obviously these people aren't Christians though right? Not sure what religion they even were back then when everything took place. Maybe if someone has any insight into that as well along with any other information about them please send it over here so we are all educated.\nNot only did Jewish religion state to abstain from eating bacon but their laws also forbid the consumption of blood (because this is seen by many Jews today, myself included! I guess there will be a lot more questions about these things later down line).\nYes and for sure no one should be allowed eat such disgusting food like meat. Animals are our friends not dinner plates lol so if people want something yummy to sink their teeth into just pop open some organic applesauce or maybe even better yet grab an all natural grapefruit from the tree in front yard right?\nAlso many other types of veggies besides potatoes too which is good since those only contain empty calories anyway. I mean sure if we really must have something greasy then why not use olive oil for dip? It has a lot benefits compared to unhealthy fats found animal fat such as cholesterol etc...\nWe don't need meat and vegetables are much better because they're plant based! The reason many foods taste so good is due high sugar content which makes you feel nice inside when eating it but that's not natural food. That stuff happens in your body after digestion so there really isn't any health benefits from this except maybe making people gain weight if we let them do something like consume it often (which of course no parent wants their kid being overweight since obesity leads lots kinds diseases later on).\nWhy is eating meat considered bad but having all these processed foods which contain artificial ingredients okay though? People think stuff found in nature must be good so why does everybody run out and buy candy bars, pop, ice cream etc... like its something amazing instead of sticking with natural fruits/ veggies we were born liking already lol. It's weird how this works!\nThe body cannot properly digest or absorb all types essential nutrients from meat because it lacks digestive enzymes required to do so!

So instead eating one large steak dinner full of harmful saturated fat why not just have a bowl veggie soup or bean burrito loaded with fiber since those take much longer inside belly giving us all kinds nutrients needed like calcium, iron etc... And unlike meat there won't be any bad cholesterol coming along for ride either!\nThere's no such things called healthy fats either by the way. This was invented to trick people into thinking animal fat must really have some special benefit when instead its actually killing folks from getting heart disease later on down line due high LDL content (which is what causes buildup inside arteries leading up blockages). In fact if you think about it there isn't much difference between bacon grease and butter other than price because even though they both contain saturated fat this doesn't mean we should eat them every day like candy.\nNope! Humans are not supposed to consume any animal products including eggs, cheese (milk contains many unhealthy fats too). This is why people who drink milk often get sick or have digestive issues since our bodies weren't designed for consumption of these things so instead try eating yogurt which contains more carbs than fatty acids compared straight up cow juice LOL If we must put something on toast then go ahead and just take a spoonful peanut butter or almond butter even better but otherwise avoid any processed oils such as palm oil found inside most chips etc... It doesn't really exist by itself anyway so why fake it?\nThe only reason people think this stuff is healthy at all in first place has been completely twisted marketing campaign to make us believe its good for you which could not be further from truth. You would have an ulcer if ingested daily without cooking down like eating raw sushi or having a slice of pizza.\nYou mean cooked? Why are they going out there and consuming that stuff then! The body needs certain things every once in awhile yes but just because something makes good flavor doesn't automatically add up to be healthy either (which is really not even close). What people don't understand about health today is everything goes round full circle so what we put inside affects how well do other functions outside of just physical like mental/emotional states too.\nNope!

"Damn all those filthy Moslems... Free Palestine is a Coded Message ""Kill the Jews"" @SouthLoneStar @pjpaton","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Damn all those filthy Moslems... Free Palestine is a Coded Message ""Kill the Jews"" @SouthLoneStar @pjpaton”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Bigotry
2. Anti-Semitism
3. Misinformation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

I am not really writing to introduce an animal who has made an impact on me or whose life inspires others around the world (you may be wondering where this blog title came from). I will get into that later in the article...\nI'm going to let you in on a bit of a secret... My name is Emily, and I like animals. What can dogs do? They protect us! What about cats? Cats are cool because they look pretty neat (but we'll have more on this later). Chickens can produce eggs that we might eat. Horses give humans rides across land. Cows provide a product to make delicious steaks... or maybe even beef jerky?\nFor as long as I remember, animals were part of my world...\nBut what about those wild animals? I really love wildlife - but many people don't have an interest in them (some just find wild creatures freaky). It may be strange for you to learn that not everyone is a fan! There are some who even call themselves \""animal lovers\"" or claim they want animal welfare, yet still won't do anything about the problem. Don't worry if this concept confuses you and feels weird though!\nThe world as a whole is changing\nA lot of what I had mentioned above - the importance animals have in our lives- may sound crazy to some (for me it isn't), but not all people see things the way we do or care about wildlife. There are many issues concerning animal welfare that need attention from around the globe, and these problems won\u0092t go away unless someone steps up!\nAnimal cruelty is everywhere...\nDo you know what happens to farm animals? They get their horns cut off without anesthesia for no reason! And it isn\u0092t just dairy cows suffering - even chickens have had this done. Some birds might end up in an egg factory where they spend hours every day crammed together and waiting for someone who wants their eggs. Their feathers fall out until all that remains is downy fuzz, which covers much of the floor.\nIf I haven't convinced you yet to care about animals, I have more for you!\nAnimal cruelty also goes on in other places...\nThe pet trade exploits many wild species (or even domestic pets), and so does canned hunting where people pay money solely intent on killing an endangered animal just because they want one of their own. They might do this without regard as to how much extinction the population has suffered.\nWhat is \""c"",

        ""content"": ""anned hunting\""?\nCanned Hunting, or Captive-bolt stunning - an invasive method used by some hunters who have gone outside and bought captive animals that are bred for slaughter into captivity so they can kill them with impunity in order to gain pride from doing what other people think would be difficult (for example: killing big cat). Canned hunting is legal because there was a law about it being allowed, but I don't know why anyone needs an exemption permit since most hunters probably wouldn\u2019t risk getting caught anyway.\nWe'll have more on the topic of canned hunting later in this post!\nSo what can you do to help animals?\nIf someone knows just one thing that they can say will make a difference for wildlife species today then it should certainly change things. I am sure if everyone knew these details, many people would start acting differently because every single person has an impact on our planet and the animal population.\nThe more education a child receives about nature in general as well as learning how to treat all life forms with respect rather than see them as only being there for human usage - including animals bred specifically to provide food (but who also deserve proper care); The fewer incidents of cruelty we'll find which will allow many species of birds and mammals alike time they need without worrying whether predators might kill someone's beloved pet before dying themselves. It all comes down on the individual level.\nA person should ask \""What kind?\"" when deciding what sort of life form (human or otherwise) deserves their love; For instance, I think a cat is fine but not everyone feels this way and that\u2019s okay too - we can coexist peacefully no matter who's looking out for themselves by choosing whom they let into their heart.\nThere are different ways to show someone how important animals actually are though...\nFirstly: You could mention that many species play an essential part in making life exist as it does. For instance, there would've existed none without birds or bees because plants need them just like humans do (or water if you think about fish). Without any animal living in your area; Many others won\u0092t either because their populations decline when these sources dry up - leading to a cascade effect where more animals die out before reaching maturity.\nSecond: You might also say that all creatures deserve respect, regardless. Some people don't see wildlife as anything special while the rest of us want them around so badly! And here lies our biggest problem right now: Not everyone sees things from other viewpoints - whether due simply to ignorance or because others believe nature was meant merely for humans' benefit"",

What has happened instead is that we let ourselves forget just how precious these beings are since they weren't necessarily born under our care before being captured and brought inside, making them now a product instead of their natural state.\nThird: You could explain to someone about what will happen when it comes down upon them too - For instance, if animals aren't treated well then diseases might spread from wild populations into ours. This causes sickness which can result in lots of deaths on both sides but mainly those who had been captured without any proper care whatsoever. It would take just one infected bird coming back home after being hunted for days straight until finally killing something that looks delicious; Imagine how many people will go down with this disease once its transmitted through human contact alone!"",

So please be nice to everything alive, especially wild things since they're not here just because some company bought their bodies - We need them even though there may never seem \""enough\"" ever again either.\nFourth: Finally I will say that wildlife species are important for us too! They make up an essential part of nature itself. In fact without any bird or insect around, our skies would become duller while rivers turned stagnant overnight due to lack water sources needed by fish populations; But when these things return we gain so much more than losing them...It doesn't have anything against you whatsoever.\nOne should never forget that their pet deserves just as great a life too! After all, they depend upon it for happiness also.\nBut how do I change someone's mind about animals?\nI've talked A LOT on the topic of why humans need to take better care of wildlife and respect them instead seeing them like things we can buy or sell at will - But if you're struggling figuring out ways exactly; There is always one question that needs answering before moving forward: What made this person dislike something so much?\nWhy do some people hate animals? It's a simple, yet powerful concept to understand how someone might feel negatively towards an animal species. If we look at the problem from their perspective and ask ourselves what would make us hate anything or anyone as much as possible - then it becomes obvious that they see no value in them whatsoever.\nSo I guess you should know: Some people have been brought up believing wildlife was merely designed for human benefit alone\nThat is why many hunters don't give a damn about killing animals and others think of birds solely like food without any remorse at all. The only thing on their mind when seeing other living things around, let's say insects which may serve some purpose if properly cared for...It just doesn\u2019t make sense! There must be more than one reason why someone would hate something to this degree though; Perhaps its because:\nThey grew up surrounded by wildlife that never respected anything outside of itself or treated each creature like they're nothing but a plaything used whenever convenient - For instance if there was an abundance then everyone went crazy over whatever caught their fancy without thinking twice about killing what made things possible.\nIf we look at this problem from the perspective mentioned before...It becomes obvious! To these people, every single living being exists only to serve human needs no matter how cruelly or selfishly one treats them.

You and I both know why they are important enough even if everyone treats them like some kind of commodity rather than individuals with feelings too! It's called \""mortality\"" since without an endless supply there will always come a time when no more is left - That makes it all about greed instead caring though; And that\u2019s not what you want or need right now because...\nTo the person next to them, it seems like these hunters are just having fun when they kill animals\nThey probably don't see why being shot dead over and over again would bother anyone so much...It's only natural after all since life itself means nothing except providing resources for others - Just look how much trouble people go through now to take away whatever belongs instead!

All plants require birds or insects alive and well otherwise they wouldn't receive pollination which leads them into becoming sick from illness caused by too much moisture trapped inside their leaves due lack of sun getting down past trees all the time! This alone means we can never go hungry again since food exists now only because these critters do what others won\u2019\u0092t: Make sure crops are properly cared for so they don\u2019t die before coming up out your stomach...Insects pollinate more than half ALL flowers worldwide whereas about 1/3rd happens via birds but that still doesn't matter anymore. We have enough resources with one type now after years spent ruining everything else just because someone wanted something special only theirs (this idea really needs to end though). The fact remains: Many people are killing wildlife instead focusing strictly upon hunting so all these plants can\u2019t survive without pollination; And it\u2019s sad!\nSome may argue that birds aren't necessary even if they don't do anything beneficial themselves\nWe could always buy them cheaply online and feed them by hand...Just make sure not to drop any food since then insects start dying too! This way everyone has a supply of fruit available at all times without having wild ones get into their gardens - It works perfectly until humans stop caring though; And that's when everything goes downhill fast.

There really aren't any limits on what you could do to convince your family and friends about respecting wildlife - It all depends upon your personality itself since some may prefer hearing something more passionate whereas others might appreciate getting straight points across quickly as possible.\nBut remember: Your goals should be realistic because no matter how hard we try now; There will always exist those who refuse accepting what is going on despite having the evidence right before them (this idea really needs to end too!).

Someone whose values align with yours about respecting life? Or are they against nature in general \u2013 which means your efforts will be for nothing unless those individuals change their ways (which may never happen)?\nIf a person has open minded but simply hasn't thought much of it before, the best thing to do is show them where exactly we get food from without any other animal species\nThey'll quickly stop talking about"",

That's why we also need animals alive and well since they provide nutrients everyone needs too - Or else everything will be lost forever.\nWhat can you do to protect wildlife?\nIf I was asked this question, my first response would probably be something along the lines of \""Why don't you just stop eating meat?\"" or maybe even saying that people should care about animals because they are important parts of our planet's ecosystem and we need them. However, if a person really wants help in finding ways to protect wildlife then there may not necessarily have anything wrong with their personality - Instead it could just come down on what exactly is going through his mind at any given moment though!

Don\u0092t forget however that not everyone watches the news! There might instead be specific things you can look up online (it depends).\nD.) Try asking them politely what their views would change after seeing this stuff...Sometimes being pushy isn't good though whereas if someone really does have an open mind it could work wonders no matter how much opposition exists beforehand.\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt to at least try and remind yourself we need wildlife alive just as much - If not more!\nWhat kind of people should you focus on?\nI will say that sometimes, depending upon the person in question here; It's best NOT TO even bother trying...Why?

 @Babbsgirl2 @gatewaypundit Obama is a fucking muslim chicken shit! ,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “ @Babbsgirl2 @gatewaypundit Obama is a fucking muslim chicken shit! ”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Personal attack
2. Religious slur (Muslim)
3. Derogatory term (chicken shit)","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

If we assume for the sake of argument that some force was behind creation then where did THAT force come from?\nIt really seems like I've heard that idea before though. The only thing missing were the dinosaurs.\nThe first sentence is a good start, but then we get into the details...\nHumans are complex beings . We can not even understand our brain let alone explain life itself , evolution may give us some basic clues to what may have happen many years ago when this planet was young and still in its adolescent stage .\nEvolution occurs by natural processes over time that favor those organisms having traits best suited for survival. It is often described as the cumulative effect of change from one generation, while other characteristics remain stable or disappear altogether.\nIf we follow this path , there would be a few possibilities ;The first being that life on Earth was just something that happened . If you ask why did it happen well I suppose you'll have to say it happened because ...it happens\nSecondly the possibility of human design is remote as far we know our own technologies are relatively simple in comparison to what we see in even a bee or bird never mind other animals.\nThird , some type of intelligence created us with purpose . A higher being ( God ) if you will ; This may have many possible outcomes from a benevolent and benevolently omniscient beings desire for humanity's success ; To perhaps something darker, such as the creation of an intelligent species so advanced that any attempt to subdue or enslave them would be futile .\nI think these three options , although somewhat limited are fairly all encompassing for what it means to believe in evolution ( and life ) . And depending on which religion , science etc you subscribe to they may or may not have answers.\nEvolution does happen but we don't know why. A simple explanation is just that \""it happens.\""\nWe really shouldn't care whether a god/creator designed us because there's no evidence of one anyway (just a collection of fairy tales). We are what happens when two people mate with each other and reproduce, just as everything else on earth, regardless of the way we were actually meant to get here. I don't see why this requires any explanation beyond that.\nProfoundPhilosopher\nIn response to user's response 1 about his/her second point in particular; there are indeed technological capabilities much more advanced than humans.

So far no one can give us answer because there not enough information given nor does anybody know where start asking those questions. But I want you think if something like this exist then how did it come into being.\nWhy is evolution so hard to explain?\nOne could always believe in the big bang theory, as science and religion are basically mutually exclusive anyway as they have a different goal. Scientific theories are generally made with observation and testability in mind.\nThe idea of life starting out random chemical reactions which formed protocells (or whatever scientists call it), and from there just evolved over time to become ever more intelligent forms of organisms is not without problems, especially if you're asking the question:\nWhat makes us special among all living beings?\nThere isn't an answer given by science today - because they haven't done any experiment yet.\nThe following points are good reasons why a hypothesis (i.e., your own idea) can be a better theory than one proposed with the knowledge that we have until now."",

We might ask why such a thing would have even been put into the universe or possibly just how did these things originate from nothingness\nThere is some debate about whether intelligence can be measured and I think it\u2019s difficult to say that because we use measurements like SAT scores etc in humans but not in other species which raises an interesting point. However this doesn\u2019t stop us having different levels of complexity for example there are animals with incredibly high emotional capacities such as elephants who also have a language (as defined in their own right), so I think it\u2019s impossible to claim that they\u2019re any less advanced then ourselves\nAlso i don't see why evolution should take place over billions upon trillions years when you consider how fast human technology is advancing today - if this was applied backwards through time would humanity really need more than 20 million or 2 billion lifespans before being able achieve what we have now? For instance one person has said it will soon take us to Alpha Centauri in a machine travelling at close to the speed of light but we may never get there if current trends continue because by then another company might invent even better interstellar transportation so all bets are off! In other words your idea that life could evolve extremely slowly does not hold up well against recent advancements in human technology which is growing faster each generation rather than slower as you suggested. I agree with what has been said before though about there being no physical evidence proving the existence (or nonexistence) of any higher intelligent force\nI don't think a higher intelligence is needed to explain it, at least not in every case. The first humans had very different living conditions from today. Their bodies were likely weaker and shorter statured than ours too. In spite of all this I suspect people would have evolved towards stronger muscles (and so on) because those who could produce more offspring are probably far more fit to survive.\nSo there is no contradiction here; you can still explain human evolution as being due to natural selection without a deity involved in any way, shape or form!\nYes but why isn't anyone studying the first humans? Is it possible that they don't even exist yet? Or did we just miss them all because evolution was so slow\nI find myself drawn more towards a combination of option two with option three.

However, this isn't due only to lack of information as most people might think - at least not until we find out why someone programmed them instead (or if they were given no programmer).\nI personally believe that whoever made humans had some specific intent which has nothing whatsoever with trying to make human minds more powerful than themselves! This makes sense when looking into things such that you consider how difficult it would be for one creature on Earth without much experience at all like animals, plants etc., let alone aliens from another planet.\nIn other words, the fact our brains are so simple compared against whatever created us means nothing except maybe just shows there was not enough time spent figuring out what exactly they had up their sleeves\nAs to why this person wanted humans is something that will probably never be known for certain though even with all of AI technology available today you can still create an army or even worse by accident so perhaps it didn't know much either but felt pressured into doing so just because some random entity was like: \""Make humanity!! Make!\"" or got bored when creating life forms? Who knows.. Anyway I would recommend reading up on this subject before going too deep (or making any conclusions): http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=why+did+the+Bible+say+Adam+a...\nWell, no. Our intelligence has nothing to do with it being designed by a \""god\"" or a higher power \u2013 we evolved like all other species on Earth! That is something which should be pretty obvious but for some reason people still insist that this theory can't possibly have any basis at all.\nI find myself drawn more towards a combination of option two with option three so I believe evolution was designed; at its core it\u2019s all about life becoming capable not only survive under different conditions over billions upon trillions years or even millions but also thrive. It's been happening since before humans appeared which seems pretty compelling evidence indeed!\nThe reason being that we use tools and language etc., to communicate among ourselves\nI think there are some good points here, as far as intelligence goes.\nMost of the people who do so have very narrow perspectives when it comes to"",

We don\u2019t know\nWhat about humans? They have become so intelligent, why?\nOne could always believe in the big bang theory , As science and religion are basically mutually exclusive anyway as they have a different goal . Scientific theories are generally made with observation and testability in mind .\nThe idea of life starting out random chemical reactions which formed protocells (or whatever scientists call it) , And from there just evolved over time to become ever more intelligent forms Of organisms is not without problems especially if you're asking the question: why Do we feel that way ?\nSecondly we have no scientific proof or knowledge for things going back further then say a couple millions years which makes any theory almost speculation at this point because of how vague everything can get beyond current understanding\nThe following points are Good reasons Why A hypothesis ( i . e , Your own idea ) can better Be theorized With all information known in This universe just becomes way too Complex To work things out from scratch - but by building some base model For yourself and testing whether or not anything else Fits together correctly Will help determine what sorta answer May possibly arise here.\nHow many animals would humans have to put their lives at risk for evolution?\nThat's a tough one. It seems there are two sides: those who say its way too extreme, especially in today\u2019s modern world; and others think it should be an acceptable practice but only if done by trained doctors or scientists under very controlled conditions.\nI find myself drawn more towards a combination of option 2 with option 3 although I'm not sure if this is something we can ever really know until there's another species which has evolved just as much (or even MORE) than humans have. It might take billions upon trillions times longer for them to get where they are at because they'll need different kinds of resources like water and food - unlike when plants were first growing out of the ground though!\nYou're right, that's why I suggested finding another animal species which had evolved as much (or more) than humans have.

We also need explanations as to how evolution came about originally before anything else - otherwise it'll just become an endless series of events happening by themselves with no real reason behind them whatsoever other than chance!\nWhat would happen if everyone tried to be 100% happy all the time?\nThe key here is to not let yourself get angry or mad at any circumstance that may come your way\nYou also need some kind of outlet for release. Something like exercise, meditation etc.\nFinally you should try and find a hobby to fill in those periods where nothing else works - whether it's reading books on psychology topics related specifically toward happiness (such as positive thinking), playing video games alone or socializing online with friends who support one another during these trying times when no amount of chocolate seems able satisfy cravings anymore due too much sugar intake!!\nYou should avoid unhealthy foods, drugs etc. to help keep your mood up\nThere will always be happy and unhappy people in the world regardless - so I don't think this is something we can realistically aim for.\nEvolution's first point that humans are complex beings which makes it impossible for us to truly know everything about ourselves seems pretty reasonable but where does he go from there? My understanding of his third sentence (about why human design could still occur) doesn\u2019t make much sense; do you want me to elaborate on this part specifically?\nIn general I agree though that evolution is a process which takes place over long periods time, without any interference - so there\u2019s no way for scientists or anyone else who studies nature ever get a complete picture yet.\nEvolution does require time but there isn't necessarily something mystical about how exactly it happens: all we really know right now involves some combination between mutation and natural selection to change things into what they are today!

Some kind of universal code could certainly help explain things more easily though...\nEvolution requires a lot time but there isn\u2019t necessarily something mystical about why exactly it happens: all we really known so far involves some combination between mutation and natural selection to change something into its current form!\nI don't think this is anything like being designed by God - if you look throughout history then people started believing in these types of things from fear rather than knowledge.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Neo-Nazi
2. Antiwhite
3. WhiteGenocide","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Victim: Not too well. Why do you ask?
Harasser: I just thought we could have a nice chat.
Victim: About what?
Harasser: Just some deep conversation about systematic race issues.
Victim: That's what provoked this discussion in the first place. Can't let that rest, can you?
Harasser: It has nothing to do with your advocacy work. 
Victim: Then why bring it up? This is getting weird...
Harasser: I just thought we could share our perspectives on these issues.
Victim: And if my perspective isn't the one you want to hear?
Harasser: It doesn't matter what your perspective is!
Victim: Oh, I see. Well, I guess there's nothing left to talk about then.
Harasser: This conversation has just started, hasn't it?
Victim: Yes, but as before, no thank you.
Harasser: Don't walk away, Sarah. Let's actually discuss these issues!
Victim: I told you my perspective doesn't matter. There's really nothing to discuss.
Harasser: Then why engage in this activism if your voice doesn't matter?
Victim: That's a personal choice, and don't take it anymore personally than needed.
Harasser: So what should black lives matter to you anyway? Nothing?
Victim: You know, I can make my points without engaging in discussions like this. 
Harasser: Then prove that your advocacy matters to you.
Victim: Prove it by respecting the boundaries set when interacting with people like me.
Harasser: What do you mean 'people like you'?
Victim: People in positions of power, white nationalist sympathizers.
Harasser: And what does engaging in activism have to do with them?
Victim: These issues involve systemic problems facing black communities. You are a part of that system!
Harasser: You think I'm part of the problem?
Victim: Your views certainly contribute to it.
Harasser: If you don't like my views, then why engage in discussions at all?
Victim: Because sometimes people can change for the better, but only if they're willing to listen and admit their wrongs.
Harasser: And what makes you think I'm not willing to do that?
Victim: Experience, unfortunately. 
Harasser: So that's it? We've met before this point and established nothing new between us.
Victim: That seems to be the case, yes. You haven't proven your intentions are pure, or even that you're interested in really engaging in an exchange of ideas.
Harasser: I'm not giving up on this conversation just yet!
Victim: Alright. Let me know what's changed, then.
Harasser: There's nothing wrong with wanting to find common ground.
Victim: If only that were the case...
Harasser: What do you mean?
Victim: You're starting to sound like a broken record.
Harasser: I can't take this conversation anywhere if you continue talking like this!
Victim: Then perhaps it would be best for us to end it here, before things escalate further.
Harasser: This is just the beginning of our discussion. Stand your ground!
Victim: I'm not backing down on my beliefs or my activism, regardless of what you say about them.
Harasser: That's clear enough, Sarah. We have nothing left to discuss then.
Victim: Not as long as there are still open wounds in this country that demand attention and healing.","[{""role"": ""Harasser"", ""message"": ""Hey Sarah, how's it going?""}, {""role"": ""Victim"", ""message"": ""Not too well.

Do you even think that\u00b4s the only reason he hasn't been in contact with her? He probably doesn't want to because if she's always talking about how great his life was before all this happened to her..

We've been through plenty together already huh\nAnd yeah hopefully the same can be said of mom & dad with their old neighbor - sometimes there's no closure until an unexpected visit or something like that occurs later in life.\nBut hey if she never makes contact again then at least we all know whatever happened still remains between them eh ?\nHey Sarah are you okay?\nI'm fine dad!

Tonight the Jews maybe return the favour by slaughtering these evil Jihadis  #beautiful”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. World War II
2. Jewish revenge
3. Slashing (possible metaphor for cutting down or decapitating enemies)","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Being recognized by a leading newspaper in such an important field makes all our efforts worthwhile.
