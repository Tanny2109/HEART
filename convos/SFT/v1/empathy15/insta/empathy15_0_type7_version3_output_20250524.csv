Ah ugly_,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Ah ugly_”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insult
2. Ugliness
3. Appearance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

However - there's no way that someone who is playing for entertainment purposes should play at less than half the speed of the example. The only reason why the teacher plays like this would be because they wanted a fast turnaround time and therefore sacrificed some sound quality (since you can't make it loud, full & clear), but also because guitar isn't technically designed to do much more than 80% of what an instrument should do - which is play music - and it was never really meant for that. So if the only thing you're getting out of a solo is notes being played fast then I'm afraid your soul is going down, brother.\nFor more info about notation conventions check out our article here: Guitar Solos\nIn this example he clearly moves position as well but only from fret 2 to fret 1.

I know how important they are at some point, but I do not yet see myself ever being good enough to develop something like that on my own as my music skills don't seem strong or interesting enough in general without them :/\nI definitely recommend learning a few chords and scales before diving into solos! It doesn\u2019t have to be rocket science either - you can also start with riffs too. I\u2019ve found it really helpful when practicing soloing just starting very simply by figuring out what my voice sounds like. Even if that\u2019s super basic, it gives ideas of how YOU may want play something.\nI feel like this is one area where most resources available for learning guitar get the presentation wrong. They do not present a \""what's happening\"" view and mostly offer a \""how to perform in your ear/hand coordination while playing along with backing track\"" kind of overview but it misses 90% of all use cases people have as musicians.\nGreat point - I think that is true for so many different skills too though. How can you really learn if all you're doing in the beginning is just watching other people do something? The more hands on experience and practice, the closer someone will be to unlocking whatever it is they want, whether soloing or anything else.\nYeah! You are definitely right there - I don't think anyone ever becomes a decent musician without actually making music though. It helps you"",

The more ways you learn - whether that's listening, trying to replicate what they're playing or any other method of your own design the better off you should be.\nA lot has been said here about this matter but I'll add my experience into it.\nIn short, there are three things preventing most people from soloing well: 1) They don't know how to play chords, so improvisation comes naturally to them as such they lack melody in their 'jam' which also makes the transition hard since now you have this whole additional skill set that needs development. 2/3 The second problem that usually comes along with it is lackadaisical attitude towards practicing anything but riffs, which might be due partially because one knows well how to do #1 but still can't just jam around all day (the only thing he does know well) - or sometimes these people even think there's no point in soloing if everyone else is just strumming anyway. This leads them into an infinite loop: 2a) since they don\u2019t feel challenged, their practice time decreases; and once it\u2019s gone then #3 kicks in that is 3) Lack of confidence to really learn something new . And when we\u2019re too afraid to explore the world then everything else has already failed.\nYou should be learning how to solo on piano with both hands playing at once. This will help you understand what's going on more for your fretting hand, so when it comes time for guitar solos you can focus just as much energy into that one side of things too!\nThis is good advice but a bit outdated - there are now plenty other instruments out there like bass guitars which can be fun to play in both hands. However I do agree with the general sentiment: learning some kind of instrument really helps understand music, solos included.\nYou would need something between chord tabs and scale diagrams\nA guitar player is always going back to their notes on the fretboard so it should give you chords rather than just open strings like most sheet music does.\nThe second thing that could help are visual cues about what notes belong in certain scales , this way when they're playing other instruments you won't have any idea of where those note fits into"",

I just saw your post about performing guitar solo. Just to clarify, for the part right after each bar of music, how should it be notated as? Would you write an X in front or behind a series of notes like C-D-A-B-E-G-F#-G#, etc?\nI don't really get what you're asking...\nFor more info about notation conventions check out our article here: Guitar Solos\nHey there! I just saw your post about performing guitar solo. Just to clarify, for the part right after each bar of music, how should it be notated as? Would you write an X in front or behind a series of notes like C-D-A-B-E-G-F#-G#, etc?\nSorry but why do people have no problem with learning the notes on their own but struggle to understand how fast and accurate one has to be in order to learn a song? It's just music, not rocket science.\nI agree that it feels like some sort of mental obstacle even more than physical. I think people tend to get intimidated by doing solos alone because they feel like they don\u2019t have enough skill or talent with their instrument which could make you want your hands glued onto another fretboard again as soon as possible after a lesson so you never lose track.\nHowever, one thing anyone can always do is just keep on playing - whether that\u2019s scales and exercises all day long for others\u2019 enjoyment while waiting in line at Starbucks maybe? Even if the music comes slow and simple it will still sound better than being completely off pitch!\nYeah, this sounds like stuff I'd listen to as far as solo-ing. However - there's no way that someone who is playing for entertainment purposes should play at less than half the speed of the example. The only reason why the teacher plays like this would be because they wanted a fast turnaround time and therefore sacrificed some sound quality (since you can't make it loud, full & clear), but also because guitar isn't technically designed to do much more than 80% of what an instrument should do - which is play music - and it was never really meant for that. So if the only thing you're getting out of a solo is notes being played fast then I'm afraid your soul is going down, brother.\nSo true!

It's because some of our writers are also musicians. Our goal wasn\u2019t initially focused on tutorials per se - rather we wanted articles that would help people learn about playing guitar in all the different ways possible. I'll pass your comment along.\nThe main reason is probably due to limitations of space and time in the song that limit one's ability to produce sounds for multiple notes at once; this prevents them from using complex arrangements like those found on horns or synthesizers which have dedicated musicians who can play each note simultaneously while also taking breaths between phrases."",

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Condescending tone
3. Silencing attempt","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Also people have been doing this for ages and still haven't come to a conclusion either way.\nThe way in which primes were first discovered has nothing to do with the properties of prime numbers per se . It is true that there seem to be no clear pattern behind them, as far as we know today (2017), although some theories suggest they may not actually always be really random - see e.g. what's called the \""Riemann hypothesis\"".\nI would say it all boils down to two simple questions:\n1) Is our Universe deterministic? In other words: If you can describe everything in sufficient detail, do mathematical equations always have precise answers? Or is there ever an element of genuine randomness?\n2) Are prime numbers governed by natural laws themselves that we don't yet fully understand, or not?\nIf so, it's hard to say exactly whether the answer to Q3 would be \""yes\"" or \""no."",

Then you could just as well argue that prime numbers themselves also have some \""laws\"" or at least are not purely random.\nBut what I meant is: Does the sequence of observed primes follow these laws strictly (so no randomness involved), or only in an average sense?\nThe whole thing is basically a philosophical question about how natural phenomena actually arise - e.g. quantum mechanics already tells us that some \""laws\"" operate on a lower scale while other higher-level constructs may seem to be probabilistic:\n1) The fact you've asked this question, and the fact I'm answering it means humanity still do not understand primes.\n2) We humans are incapable of comprehending all natural numbers because we evolved in world where number is finite (up to billions), but mathematics extends into infinite values. You can never prove any result about a class which contains an infinite set that cannot be mapped 1:1 with your input variables such as a computer or the brain.\nI'd say that primes are random, for at least 2 reasons:\n1) If they weren't, people would have found an algorithm to predict them by now. It is more likely that they're not predictable\n2) Any algorithm which attempts it may take so long to find one, that we cannot test its entire operation in reasonable time.\nIt was my hope the post of this question would elicit some replies from others about what might be random and what isn't random - I realize many feel that the prime numbers are random however I am not convinced. There's no evidence these have ever been predicted or generated at will by anyone which seems a good clue they're indeed randomly generated. What do you all think is truly random in math? The primes can be found if one knows where to look but what would constitute generating them on your own, for example?\nThe most important thing was that people tried over such a long time and never succeed. That says something about the difficulty of proving it either way.\nAlso I believe many prime numbers have been predicted already.\nI don't think there's any \""proof\"" to be found because finding out one side would mean we just got lucky, so no matter whether this is random or has some form of underlying rule - you're never going to prove anything other than a long-shot"",

Do you really believe that someone has predicted some prime numbers? The only number one could get from a prediction algorithm would likely be in regards to how many primes exist between certain values - which doesn't actually tell us anything except perhaps the total amount of primes on earth right now or the average distance between 2 primes.\nI don't think there is any proof as it simply cannot be proven. But I still feel that my initial guess of randomness might have a small advantage in the unlikely event we can really prove one way over the other - just cause of how humans would probably respond if we do find out. If it turns into prime numbers being random, then people are free to make bets & try algorithms and so on. But what happens if someone actually figures that they're not? I don't see anybody getting too excited about this as there won't be any benefit in knowing or even an end to the quest.\nThere is no real proof either way unfortunately but just trying for decades without finding anything doesn't really tell us much at all - it could be random, it could have some other form of rule that someone hasn't come up with yet, and maybe we simply haven't had good enough computers or knowledge even back in the days where people got started. This still leaves things quite open imho.\nThere's no way to find out unless prime numbers are found in sequence which is obviously highly unlikely - how would anyone know what their next digit should be? Even if there was an algorithm to calculate them it wouldn't prove they were being generated randomly, only possibly that someone had just come up with the answer."",

It seems too easy to predict if they were just following the same pattern, plus we'd already be able to detect some kind of mathematical 'signal' that suggested this was happening rather than randomness but none is apparent as far as I can tell.\nI think it all boils down to a fundamental question: what are prime numbers even there to serve? If you had someone who knew every algorithm in the world, and could make up any new ones they wanted at will - would they still be able to predict primes after being given enough information about previous patterns?\nIn other words if I can calculate 1000 primes but somehow miss some of them out (perhaps randomly), do you think an infinitely intelligent computer might spot something in my results? And could it use its knowledge & logic to find the 'rule' and so be able to predict future numbers too just given data about previous ones?\nTo me this seems not like a mathematical problem, but more that any rule would have been written by someone on Earth (i.e. as far as we know there is also no outside intelligence or god-like being controlling things). But prime numbers might still be predictable if they were created using very advanced mathematics from some hypothetical aliens who had better understandings of certain things than us. Even for that to happen, you'd have to first work out why and how the primes are what we see - there's nothing simple about them at all.\nWhat I mean by it being impossible though is a few things: 1) Someone needs to find some kind of math 'signal' as part of an original algorithm 2) Such algorithms can get very complicated, but they're still just made up and in theory could have been found out for existing prime numbers. It would be hard even with billions more people & computers - especially if we hadn't noticed there even was anything to discover because it's usually easier looking backwards at a long time series than forwards.\nThe point about not being able to prove something isn\u2019t helpful here though, as just about everything can\u2019t be scientifically proven. Also, since prime numbers are known and have been studied by lots of people for hundreds or perhaps thousands of years \u2013 there is no evidence suggesting they follow some form of mathematical law which we"",

Also, there's no way I'd claim there is such a law because even if primes actually follow some pattern, we've yet been unable to find any proof and likely never will. If so then they're effectively as good as random from our standpoint.\nI wonder what that means though? Does the computer always pick prime numbers when it guesses or does it happen rarely (e.g 1% of the time) while still giving a majority of its answers of which are primes even thought you can't prove this happens - essentially they're only truly random in terms of how long one has to wait before seeing them.\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much evidence either way, so it seems we might never really know for sure \u2013 but if I had to guess based off my own thoughts about things then yes , these prime numbers do seem quite random.\nThat's not strictly true though: They may sometimes be produced by a rule with the computer or your calculator and hence they aren't truly 'random'.\nHowever, this doesn't always happen - so there is still some randomness involved depending whether you use an old enough system. For example say I was using Windows XP to generate primes 10 years ago. The answer might just as well be random.\nSo for a true measure of what exactly constitutes random in math you need something that isn\u2019t affected by computer systems or the laws of any one country/world where it runs either, and there has never been anything like that unfortunately so maybe we are left trying to use our own logic instead. You could say \u2018if I made up my own system would primes be predictable\u2019 and just see what happens \u2013 but this is still difficult as you need some math skills at least too.\nNot entirely random - because computers can only follow certain programs which themselves might result in the answer being either of two types: prime/non-prime. The actual answer isn't then 'fully unpredictable' from a computer\u2019s point-of-view (it'll choose one out of 2 things) but your calculator cannot tell you why before it gives its prediction \u2013 and that's basically where true randomness starts to come in I guess.\nThis is the tricky bit though, because we're assuming computers always follow some kind of pattern - while there isn't necessarily any such thing: It doesn\u2019t"",

Some calculators do have 'random number generators' after all i.e. ones which can sometimes pick non-real numbers and even ones whose output is truly uniform across their whole range so if you used these instead for prime tests then maybe it would give better results ?!\nSo far my opinion has remained unchanged but having said that I suppose there could be hidden mathematical rules governing the universe - as long as they're unpredictable. The trouble may just in this case lie with our own limited knowledge and not some deep secret about reality.\nIf you want your calculator to pick random numbers then yes \u2013 it will do this sometimes , although for most people any \u2018random\u2019 number generated by a computer isn't really going to be good enough as they tend to have repeating sequences or patterns etc . This also applies when calculating prime numbers because the output of some randomization algorithms is still mathematically predictable even if we cannot see every step.\nBut yes I guess that's true - there can always be unknown rules hidden within anything, including calculators and computers: Perhaps something as simple as two or more formulas being evaluated before picking an answer (even a seemingly \u2018random\u2019 one). Such methods could potentially mask almost any underlying pattern from us but aren\u2019t necessarily required here anyway.\nIt may just boil down to probability & statistics in the end then. It's not clear exactly how many prime numbers exist however if my math is correct we can say at least there are 0 that don't occur while perhaps most of these do as well - suggesting something must govern it but only very loosely so since it works out like a lottery (there being one big winner and potentially millions more who miss out).\nIt gets harder to guess the likelihood when looking for primes beyond even prime numbers - this is why I said they may be random because unless there's some clever math I'm unaware of, probability becomes increasingly difficult as the number increases i.e. after each step you can usually only exclude a fixed amount and so it grows slower than the overall size of possible values (like dividing 3 into fractions).\nFor example if asked do these two primes occur or not : , then there is definitely an unknown underlying rule for them because although all answers are either true/false, those must have been predicted before. But as far as what happens beyond this point: We can't say anything in particular about the next prime i.e. it may be rare and even if you had two of them already \u2013 their sequence still isn"",

How much this actually affects us would depend however since we don't know how many are needed before getting the right answer so it's hard to say exactly without knowing what 'enough' means.\nI get your point about statistics though - they may not always give us definite answers but could still reveal things we otherwise wouldn't have had: There is no reason why the sequence of these particular primes has zero probability because even if true, nothing would prevent future ones being added or removed over time which suggests something else might also be at work (the universe doesn\u2019t just stop existing after all). It's possible to predict events by their likelihood but it isn't always straightforward like when trying solve questions about math.\nThis is probably why we can confidently say things like 'there must exist a number x where for every n < infinity, the equation Yn = sin(n)+sin(x) has no solutions'. There are many unknowns here and so some may even seem random but our understanding of maths gives us confidence that they do follow patterns which if not known could still be found with enough work \u2013 making anything possible (though much harder).\nA bit less relevant here perhaps I suppose because there isn't necessarily a single correct answer for primes as far as probability goes: It is true however when it comes to calculating random numbers. For example 'random number generators' used in computer games and cryptography are actually only pseudo-random - they generate non-repeating sequences but these tend not be truly uniform due limitations like their fixed size or having cycles etc (though improvements can make this more difficult)."",

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

We cannot tell the difference between stupidity and expertise\u2013and there is no good reason that makes sense to us.\nThere are three reasons why this disconnect exists as far is climate science goes\u2013and if you stop right now, read those 3 reasons before reading on, it will improve your comprehension of what follows.\n\u2013First and most obviously, unlike many scientific areas which depend entirely or primarily on mathematics or lab work conducted under strict controls and by highly trained experts, most of our information about the Earth\u2019s climate comes from observations\u2013both satellite data and ground based instruments that cannot be tightly controlled. While satellites are accurate to an extent I doubt you fully appreciate in its implications for everyday life (I don\u2019t know a single person who can relate their daily activities on a second by second basis, but modern clocks tell time to the nanosecond without any human intervention), they still aren\u2019t perfect and their readings change over time. Ground based instruments have some of these flaws as well.\nAll observations in nature are prone to error unless they occur inside an environment which has been completely controlled for all other variables\u2013and a global model isn\u2019t like that. It is simply not possible\u2013or at least, it would cost far too much money and require so many safeguards we don\u2019t know how to build yet (and I mean the people who already live today in this world)\u2014to isolate just one of Earth\u2019s climate variables without altering another. You can\u2019t increase temperature by a fraction of an iota without changing other things like relative humidity, pressure, precipitation rates\u2026we have no way whatsoever right now to do experiments at that miniscule degree and scale.\n\u2013Even though most evidence for anthropogenically induced warming comes from direct observation (and some computer simulation models), it is not the only method, as we shall see. The first reason why climate science doesn\u2019t make sense as you experience your own life on Earth can be traced in large part to these methods that don\u2019t use instruments.\n\u2013Most of what we believe about evolution came into the world more than 140 years ago when two different theories for how our species came to exist clashed in a bloody battle so titanic it ended up"",

One was religious orthodoxy, and those who believed in god (this excludes all forms of atheist materialism) thought human beings were created exactly as they now appear by some divine entity.\n\u2013The first scientists who took the evolutionary challenge seriously did not have an explanation for where modern humanity came from; their theories focused on animals more than people. But there was widespread curiosity about our strange history\u2026even though the \u201cwhy should I care?\u201d question never really seemed to arise much at all (it has, however, in more recent times when Darwinism is taught\u2013but that might have something to do with how it\u2019s being pushed by atheistic materialists). The best guess scientists could come up had no direct or reliable support at the time\u2013but since their theories were not only consistent with what was then known from other science but also logically coherent, they gained some traction.\nThat process can be boiled down this way. What actually happened is unknown and unknowable except in general terms without new evidence so scientists look for a theory explaining how humanity could have evolved and that explanation\u2013while having no direct or specific basis to it\u2013can provide insights into what we must expect the world to resemble and thus serves as an accurate guide for predictions, if not explanations.\nThis kind of speculative scientific reasoning can be justified on its own merits when used in areas like geology. Geologists cannot tell us accurately how long ago geological events which they observe today occurred (because such a method doesn\u2019t exist yet). They must use theories instead\u2013but since no theory is ever certain, at most you can assume that all the current evidence is consistent with it\u2026and since only a few competing explanations usually exists for what we know, then one of them has to be right so you go with whichever sounds best\u2026and as more data comes in which could falsify both theories (the \u201cfalsification\u201d part being the difference between science and other kinds of speculative reasoning), that strengthens your confidence in it.\nIn physics\u2013most notably quantum mechanics and relativity theory\u2013you end up treating many areas where no experiments can be done either because they are too large or small to study reliably, or too complicated (and hence expensive) compared with all the benefits we could possibly gain from studying them. And again you must use speculation as a guide for your expectations\u2026but if the theory you favor is simple yet explains multiple phenomena, then it will become more and more convincing over time by successfully predicting previously unproven observations.\n\u2013But when you have so many people that are not well informed about how"",

This is because human beings have an irrational \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d whereby we assume anything which seems to support our current beliefs\u2013and hence does not challenge us\u2013must be right while those that would otherwise question them must lack credibility and are suspect.\n\u2013When people come across complex theories they don\u2019t fully understand, it naturally leads to them assuming either everything is wrong with the explanation or nothing at all is. This tendency gets exaggerated among most who have little education because in these cases so much about what surrounds them seems like something which is true yet only based on things we learned secondhand and/or never studied carefully. For example someone who hears \u201cscientists claim global warming may cause droughts\u201d may be inclined to think it can\u2019t possibly apply to their local area where there\u2019s a lot of rain or snow, because they know that just from observations (often based on things like what kind of crops people grow). This is especially true if you do not believe the theory should apply in most places which leads one to focus only the times when such drought are present and ignoring all other data.\n\u2013But science doesn\u2019t work this way. It looks at both sides, it does not consider just the cases that fit your expectations but those which don\u2019t as well or seem unlikely based on common sense alone (which is not scientific reasoning). Science treats its theories as mere explanations for what we know until tested; everything from an earthquake all the way to the theory of relativity must undergo this process before being judged. The most basic principle in science is that if a theory cannot be refuted then it is worth believing.\n\u2013And hence scientists will often see something, develop their own explanation as to why it occurred (that might not agree with everything we know about reality so far or other parts of the explanation remain questionable) and they can test those against what else has been noted over many decades. They do this by seeking ways in which one idea disagrees with another; usually these are specific enough that when both explanations have to predict something related, you end up with a conflict\u2013and it must be resolved either way if only because no scientist can ever know for sure whether they got lucky on every prediction.\n\u2013So we can now see why climate science does not make sense like other scientific disciplines appear."",

Finally we\u2019ll discuss some predictions made by the theory itself that should affect people\u2019s lives today and how its critics have tried to explain them away.\n\u2013This first example is probably something you\u2019ve heard of before\u2013and it might even be obvious if not immediately clear just why I am citing this observation as one of my \u201cdirect\u201d examples since after all there are no complex formulas involved (and hence no need for math knowledge).

But when this was first noticed back then, many people simply thought scientists were trying to pull a fast one; they couldn\u2019t believe why anyone would try using their evidence (i.e., these weird temperature records) against something so clearly wrong or just baseless.\n\u2013There is no good reason for believing that there must be such things as \u201crecord breaking\u201d events which happen at specific times and repeat themselves year after year. Yet this belief has been in some form or another ever since humans began recording weather data with much detail; we simply cannot avoid it even today\u2013and I don\u2019t think any human will completely stop using record warmest maximums (and coldest minimums) as an argument when trying to explain something that doesn\u2019t make sense about current trends.\n\u2013What do you imagine would happen if scientists suddenly announced their findings from 1976? It\u2019s easy enough now since everything has been so carefully explained\u2013and yet it wasn\u2019t always like this. There were many who believed (or still believe) science as a whole is an elaborate scam; no doubt some will look at these anomalies and just laugh them off without even trying to learn about what they signify today.\n\u2013So when you see evidence that global warming exists, think back on how easily people can make up reasons why it doesn\u2019t actually happen or might not be related with anything strange going on around us.

We were wrong\u2026these things don\u2019t happen due to climate change!\u201d.\n\u2013As an analogy we can look at a common debate that has raged throughout history ever since people first started writing history down: Do great empires always rise and fall for some natural cycle which makes certain nations powerful while others will be left weak? This question is actually quite difficult because there are many different ways you could test it even today\u2013and every single approach I can think of is highly problematic or just downright flawed. However, most people seem to believe (or at least used to) that this hypothesis must surely be true; they have a hard time believing all nations are governed by random decisions so whatever pattern emerges is real\u2026and hence explanations which show no such regularity will usually not gain much traction.\n\u2013This sort of thinking has been going on since the dawn of human history. People were always looking for patterns and trying to explain these as if it could be predicted somehow, because we feel safer when things happen at predictable times instead of being completely random (and perhaps even mysterious).

What do you imagine happens if someone points out every time there was a big disaster during summer, then winter also gets cold more often? Many people think this should happen because they have no other natural explanation for why both seasons become equally extreme at certain times\u2013and yet any attempt one might make (beyond just saying that winter usually is bad too) will not work well enough.\n\u2013So what makes you so sure there isn\u2019t some deeper pattern which explains all these observations?

So how should you expect this pattern of events to work? Should there be some reason for them occurring together, or would it just end up happening on its own due random chance since coldness itself has no impact whatsoever in most ways?\n\u2013If I was guessing without much thinking beforehand (and even after looking into your question), then based upon my belief that \u201cglobal warming\u201d should not exist at all\u2026it wouldn\u2019t make sense for both seasons to become equally bad very often because they don\u2019t really matter too much outside of direct experience with weather conditions or how things grow\u2013and also since most animals live pretty close together anyway even during extreme times unlike humans who travel far away from where ever it gets cold (or hot).\n\u2013The fourth case is one everyone already knows about: sea level rise.

This has several important implications: First, it means there actually isn\u2019t much difference between what most people think when they hear some claim from a source they trust versus someone else says something similar but sounds less credible by saying it without providing any evidence at all; both cases rely heavily on prior beliefs about how things should work which have no real connection or relationship whatsoever"",

While it would not make much sense for a theory about global warming vs no man-made climate change (or anything similar) to say human beings have very little impact on everything despite being one species out of millions all interacting with each other\u2013and yet scientists sometimes do use such approaches by saying certain parts should remain constant over time while others may vary unpredictably; so don\u2019t be too quick to jump into thinking there\u2019s some magical mechanism at work!\n\u2013Lastly, we can consider why this happens. To understand better perhaps it helps knowing how humans think in general; the brain uses pattern recognition as a way of making sense out of otherwise overwhelming amounts information (which are much more complicated than those found during evolution), and yet when faced with something truly new sometimes even our best attempts at understanding fail miserably. So while science has certainly progressed far beyond primitive times, there will always be occasions where scientists have no good explanation for why things should work the way they do\u2013whether that\u2019s because too much complexity exists between variables making it impossible to pin down exactly how everything fits together or just human limitations in fully grasping everything going on."",

In such cases scientists usually make predictions based upon which version makes strongest claim overall rather than simply going with whichever agrees better on every point\u2013this is why you will sometimes also see conflicting findings within one field.\nSecond though this may surprise many readers it turns out most scientific progress comes not from looking at new phenomena, but instead finding previously discovered facts much later in life or other areas entirely which can be applied to seemingly unrelated matters! We know about relativity today because Einstein realized certain laws governing gravity must apply equally well when traveling close speeds as well (and also how matter behaves differently). You see such things quite frequently in most fields since so often we learn something totally new while studying different questions\u2013and it seems almost no one expects researchers to come up with all possible uses for their discoveries ahead of time. Thus when a given model is found still fit fairly close after decades or more later, people assume its basically proven correct but sometimes just means there was another aspect not yet considered\u2026which doesn\u2019t matter much since only few cases actually fail due lack true explanatory value anyway.\u201d\nThe \u201cAtheistic Materialism and Scientific Realism\u201d section was removed for length.

Home wrecking ass hoe...Laura and Gloria should have beat that ass????”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insulting language
2. Location references
3. Accusatory tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

We'll show you how to groom your horse before mounting up so they're nice and comfy in their saddle. Trust us; your mount will thank ya for it later!

Whether you're just taking a leisurely trail ride or competing in an event , there are important steps that every rider should follow before mounting their horse . In this article we will discuss what those safe measures and preparations entail - so let's get started!\nThe most crucial factor when it comes to safe riding involves clothing \u2013 both yours, as well as the safety gear for your mount. Riders must have strong boots designed specifically for equestrian activities; these can help protect feet from any jostling during movement on uneven terrain or jumps over obstacles along a path. Additionally all participants should also wear helmets equipped with chin straps to ensure maximum protection in case of falls and other potential accidents while riding horses.\nNext comes saddle preparation, which is equally important for horseback safety measures. Saddles must fit not only the size but also shape of each individual animal; there are special fittings available from expert saddlers who can make sure this applies across all species sizes too! The stirrups should always be at proper length depending upon rider height - allowing them to keep their legs locked firmly around the saddle throughout movement \u2013 while secure girths offer extra assurance that the horse will remain securely fastened in place no matter how hard they struggle within it during activity periods such as galloping sessions or other more extreme forms of exercise.\nAdequate grooming is essential too; this step prevents skin irritations caused by frayed clothing rubbing against bare flesh areas (such sweat glands) but also minimises the risk posed from any potential contact with dirt particles which may contain bacterial contaminants if left unattended \u2013 leading ultimately leading cause injuries should bacteria invade wound sites made due poor personal hygiene standards not"",

Grooming helps ensure that both you and your equine partner feel comfortable during rides by removing dirt or debris from each other\u2019s bodies.\nStart with brushing down your horse\u2019s coat; use a soft bristle brush for long-haired breeds such as Arabians while using an extra-firm version on shorter- coated types like Quarter Horses. Be generous when applying shampoo - this helps protect against bacterial infections which can cause skin irritations later in the day! For particularly messy areas (e.g., underarms), use a rubber curry comb instead of bristles\u2014you\u2019ll be able get rid stubborn dirt without damaging sensitive hair follicles.\nNext up comes cleaning out manes & tails using either a hard plastic or metal shedding blade - this will help spread natural oils throughout coat more evenly. Make sure not go into the skin though; too much pressure could lead nasty bruises! Finish off with some conditioner at last rinsed away \u2013 doing so adds lustrous shine while leaving behind protective nutrients that keep fur waterproof.\nFinally, make sure any tack like saddles or bridles fit properly before mounting up\u2014uneven wear points from improper positioning can affect how comfortable both rider and horse feel during rides.

Spray conditioner onto wet coat then work it through with a soft brush until all strands are smooth & silky looking.\n7 . Finally give them one last rinse before rubbing dry using towel or air-dryer for faster results!\nHow to Choose Your Saddle\nChoosing the right saddle can be as important and rewarding as finding your perfect horse. Whether you opt for an English style, Western model, Endurace seat design, side-saddles, bareback riding systems, saddled horses (yes--this is a thing!), or equestrian alternatives like donkeys , ponies or mules; the key consideration should always be comfort and safety.\nLet's start with finding out what kind of terrain you will mainly be taking part in. Whether it\u2019s on even ground trails around town or deep into forested backcountry \u2013 understanding how your saddle fits against both body shape/size as well as riding style is crucial so invest time getting fitted! If cost permits opt for custom made models since there no one size that truly suits all.\nFinally consider materials used in construction like leather vs synthetic; natural fibers may offer more breathability while synthetics provide better moisture resistance which comes out handy during longer trips or inclement weather days. And always remember: take advice from experienced local riders when selecting new gear\u2014afterall they know best what works well within region!\nRide Smart\nGaining the knowledge and skill of how to ride a horse is one thing, but knowing when to use your skills safely in order to prevent potential dangers can be just as difficult. Riding smart requires both focus on safety precautions and understanding terrain for optimum protection from all around danger.\nTo start with, it\u2019s always important that riders take time each morning before getting into the saddle by checking over any loose tack items like bridle or cinch straps which could become slack during ride; if left unattended this might cause damage either to horse itself or rider \u2013 both unwanted outcomes! It's also good practice occasionally inspect hoof shoes for wear & tear; worn away nails may lead horses tripping/falling while out riding so please double check before going on trips.\nWhen heading into different"",

For example, mountain bikers would likely opt heavier headgear than cyclists traveling along flat roads since roadways lack inclines & falls more common up hill paths compared flatland streets \u2013 thus higher protection needed!\nTaking proper safety measures throughout your adventures also mean keeping close eye on weather patterns (especially those involving lightning) plus animals nearby especially if wild or domesticated. Lightning storms pose serious threats even at long distances away so plan accordingly by avoiding them entirely; always bring waterproof poncho too just case need arises! As far as critter concerns go be aware that some species like deer can spook easily while dogs might see riding horses as potential prey - both reasons enough warrant extra caution near fauna!\nUltimately though remember there\u2019s only so much human beings know about nature; stay open minded adaptable during escapades regardless unpredictable surprises arise just follow basic rules: check your tack / equipment beforehand, modify gear where necessary & look out all directions including above sky below earth\u2026 then trust instincts! Good luck :)\nHow to Ride the Horse\nLearning how to ride a horse is an exciting and rewarding experience. Whether you're riding for fun or competition , there are many different things that need to be considered in order to make sure that both you and your mount have an enjoyable time.\nThe first step of becoming comfortable with horses involves getting used-to their smells (which may not always smell like roses) as well as physical contact; this helps build up trust between rider and horse so they can work together better when it comes time for the ride. Once relaxed around each other, a good foundation has been laid - now more advanced techniques such as mounting off either side of the saddle are possible! With these basics down pat, riders should start introducing simple exercises like walking circles in both directions before moving on gradually to trotting and cantering at walk speed first then progressing into canters from collected trots; once this stage has been mastered \u2013 gallops await!\nLastly but definitely not least - good riding involves paying attention while keeping eyes up so that you don't forget about all those other things like following directions correctly, managing body position effectively etc. All these elements come together when doing jumps or obstacles courses too! With practice over time (and some extra encouragement), anyone can become more confident in their abilities thanks to the trust built between horse and rider during their sessions together \u2013 no matter whether it's casual rides around town or serious competitions down track away!\nFrequently Asked Questions about Horse Riding"",

A safe, well-fitting saddle as well as an adjustable stirrup length are essential components in order to have a good riding experience . Additionally, having the appropriate amount of energy expended during the journey will help ensure that both rider and horse remain calm throughout their travels.\n2. How do I know if my horse is ready for me? To determine whether or not your mount is properly prepared \u2013 first assess its behaviour around people by observing any signs such as nipping at them or shying away from contact from others; then evaluate the animal\u2019s reaction to being saddled up and mounted, paying close attention for body language changes (such as head tossing) which may indicate unease with that particular rider. Finally make note of their gaits since this can be a good indicator too - if there are excessive pauses during walking or unusual movements whilst trotting then something may not quite feel right between them.\n4 Tips & Resources to Safely Ride Your Horse\nWhen riding horses, it\u2019s important for both you and your mount that safety comes first. Here are some tips:\n1) Get fitted \u2013 ensure the saddle is properly sized so as much weight possible sits in its centre of balance; adjust cinch straps until they\u2019re just tight enough while allowing even pressure around all parts.\n2) Choose a well-trained horse \u2013 before taking any rides make sure he or she was professionally trained by an accredited coach who knows how to teach correct techniques when dealing with various gaits like walking, canter etc., as well as basic obedience commands such as halt stop turn left & right which could be lifesaving if something does go wrong during your ride!\n3) Be mentally prepared \u2013 stay relaxed even under stress; keep focus on what's happening around you including other horses/riders nearby; anticipate movements ahead of time so adjustments can quickly follow rather than reacting after an incident occurs.\n4) Listen carefully to instructions given from coaches/instructors - make sure they understand the desired outcome before each practice session then listen actively during critique afterwards - both positive feedback regarding skill progression & constructive criticism about areas where improvement might help with better overall performance outcomes!"",

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Sleep criticism
3. Shower recommendation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).

Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.

If the number on that machine isn\u2019t exactly what it was yesterday than it can put one into panic mode, as well being depressing since people always equate weight loss with vanity and not healthfulness (more important).\nDon\u2019t let people say things about how \u201cthin\u201d or \u201cscary\u201d you are to push yourself harder! Your size shouldn\u2019t be based on comments from others anyways. The number should not determine your self esteem or any of the other things that may hold us down emotionally, because for some reason we as Americans think it is an appropriate measurement tool.\nYou have lost more than 25 pounds in about seven months. This isn\u2019t \u201ctaking\u201d a long time! Keep going you CAN and will reach your goal!\nWhen working out (and especially cardio) always make sure to drink lots of water. This keeps us hydrated but also helps the body flush toxins and fat out quicker while preventing our muscles from being cramped. Also we often confuse signals that come with exhaustion for hungry when exercising so just remember this, after finishing your workout have a little snack to replace what you burnt!\nI was never good at math so I always stuck to weight watchers\u2019 food points (which is basically based off of caloric intake). But one very important thing they teach you in order to get the maximum result from that plan is not all calories are created equal. In other words eat quality foods and make sure it\u2019s portion controlled.\nAnd as for protein, the amount recommended changes depending on your body so you have to know how much to consume! Most people don\u2019t but I\u2019m going through an intense workout program right now with a ton more activity hours added because of that \u2013 which means my metabolism is running at max capacity and I need extra grams every 2-3 hours. This could be different for everyone.\nAlso, make sure when choosing protein (which should usually come from red meat in your daily caloric intake) look to try to avoid fat (I\u2019m told you can only eat about 10g per day). Instead if the recipe calls for it replace that with a vegetable or something else!\nSarahLyn I hope these tips help! Good luck and keep up all the hard work, remember results will show slowly over time since this is such an intense lifestyle but they will come \u2013 just don\u2019t give up.\nWhat are some of your experiences in trying to lose weight as well?\nI am now at 160 pounds and"",

I am new here and just want say how happy I am that WW has finally brought it's online support group back.\nThat being said, let me introduce myself. My name is Joesph (some people call me Jo or Joey) and at the height of my overeating episodes which would last on average for 2-3 weeks straight until my stomach started growling - I weighed in at 285lbs! It wasn\u2019t an easy pill to swallow but finally after almost two years now since my lowest weight so far (which was about 215 lbs) not only am I down closer than ever before with just over 50 pounds left ahead of me, the best part about all this is what everyone kept on telling me during those darkest hours that has proven true time and again in my eyes: \""Don\u2019t look at how much you gained, rather appreciate where your losing!\""\nNow don't get me wrong here I'm still human after all so there are days where I feel like giving up which will inevitably happen every now & then but by focusing not on what is bad, instead learning to replace those thoughts with something more positive has truly made such a huge difference for my mental health overall.\nSo far it\u2019s working really well especially when comparing the amount that\u2019s gone down from before compared next to where we are at today! Plus all this extra energy never hurts too either haha.\nHave you noticed any similar changes in your own journey thus far?\nI'm looking forward having more meaningful conversations with others on here as well as sharing tips or advice if needed going back n' forth :) I mean, let's face it without each other what would life even be like???"",

That is a pretty significant drop in your weight :) But don't worry about those extra pounds here and there, it'll come off over time. The most important part of this journey if maintaining healthy habits so we can eventually achieve our goals long term!\nI love to hike since I grew up outside exploring nature \u2013 being closer (and hopefully moving) to Hawaii will be amazing for that! What was your biggest challenge?\nOne thing everyone tells me when they get to the plateau is \u201cjust keep going!\u201d If you are eating right and working out at a good pace, then it\u2019ll break sooner or later.\nYou might also try looking into something like Weight Watchers (online) since it helps with controlling intake as well :) That being said there aren't any miracle diets; while things always seem to get faster in the beginning they tend slow down towards middle so it\u2019s important not be too hard on yourself if progress isn\u2019t happening quickly, sometimes life just gets busy!\nIt's natural that you feel some guilt about eating out with friends but don't give into negative self talk! They'll only make you feel worse about what happened afterward. Instead think back fondly over good experiences \u2013 this could turn into something that inspires change for next time.\nAlso try talking through your struggles instead of bottling up feelings inside too much else it might get too overwhelming (which wouldn\u2019t even really help in the end haha). I know sometimes it's easier said than done but people usually say things just because they care so try opening yourself to them first! :)\nHow about getting an accountability partner? That way if you feel bad on a certain day knowing another person is working towards similar goals will only make both more motivated :)\nSo yeah, take deep breaths and know that while it happens sometimes we don't have full control over every situation, eventually those times fade away :) So just remember this time too shall pass!\nI would love to hear what you are thinking about my responses! If there's anything I can help with please let me know ;P\nHey SarahLyn. First things first: CONGRATULATIONS on losing soooooo much weight recently!!!\nYou should really celebrate that accomplishment before thinking of what you could do differently next time since it\u2019s hard for us humans to appreciate the progress we\u2019re making when going down hill but sometimes easier if looking up as far ahead ("",

I've been there more times than I can count unfortunately (haha). Something we can do is take comfort in knowing those types of situations aren\u2019t actually going away anytime soon because no matter how well balanced and disciplined one might have themselves the odds are sometimes inevitable - whether it's just being out with friends or something that even feels out of control.\nIt may sound impossible though but don't beat yourself up too bad for these slips; if anything view them as learning opportunities! That way you won\u2019t feel so much shame which often leads into negative patterns that are more harmful later down the road (whereas this could easily help build trust back within self).\nSo yeah, take deep breaths and think about what went wrong then focus forward moving towards better habits :) You got all those skills mastered - just keep applying them!\nIs there still anything specific I can help you with? If so let me know please :)\nYeah! How has it been going lately?\nI've really learned that dieting doesn't have to be hard. Eating smaller meals more often is the best solution for making sure we don\u2019t feel hungry during the day because no single food item will keep us full without being too much.\nA little trick I use now: before dinner, when all the work has been done and it's time just relax with family/friends; instead of reaching out straight away towards that big plate full of deliciousness, first have something light first like vegetables and drink lots water!\nI know some people who try to avoid any food because they say this helps them eat less but in my experience we've all had those \""one bite leads into many\"" so if anything it gives freedom not having restrictions on one thing; instead giving permission eat whatever you desire without worrying about how many calories are involved (which also removes guilt when overeating later down line haha ).\nSo yea, find something smaller before sitting with friends and family that'll fill up appetite while still leaving room want more. Then enjoy time together rather just focusing eating! :)\nWhat do YOU think of this idea? If there\u2019s anything I can help you with let me know please :D\nSarahLyn it sure is a challenge dieting but not impossible by any means!\nIt all depends on the effort we put"",

It all comes down making lifestyle choices work specifically YOUR body type :)\nSo yeah try different activities until finding what fits best - you'll know it when see how great feel afterward :) Good luck!\nHi Joesph, thank you for sharing your story!

Nigga u ain't got no job man,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Nigga u ain't got no job man”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Verbal aggression
2. Lack of employment
3. Racial slur","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

"@katherinejean79 ""5 million year old fuck"" I just died of laughter ___ soo funny and I agree","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “@katherinejean79 ""5 million year old fuck"" I just died of laughter ___ soo funny and I agree”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Humor
2. Amusement
3. Agreement","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Delete request
3. Profanity","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.

Ok really Lexi .. You don't fucking know her so stop acting like she's your best freakin friend ! Leave my best friends alone . Jeez ! @lexi_volleyball_2,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Ok really Lexi .. You don't fucking know her so stop acting like she's your best freakin friend ! Leave my best friends alone . Jeez ! @lexi_volleyball_2”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Lexi
2. Best friend
3. Anger","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

If they don\u2019t give me another option, I\u2019ll be obliged to start calling people on the phone and telling them things about it that will make them question why they ever listened to me in the first place. Do you know what I\u2019m talking about? You\u2019re not supposed to think about how a book can influence your life.\nIt\u2019s just one of those unimportant activities that makes no distinction between us and any other people out there. It\u2019s up for discussion whether or not people read, regardless of the topic they choose to engage in conversation with me, which is why we\u2019ve had this chat so numerous times before today.\nFor some reason I am unable to get rid of them since it seems that all women do is discuss books and what they are reading. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a debate about literature; it simply needs to be conducted at the appropriate time in an effort towards making progress forward.\nIt just doesn\u2019t make sense for people to spend hours upon days chatting about something so unimportant when there may not even have been a moment of learning exchanged between them. We can see that they are wasting their attention on these kinds of discussions, which should be used to concentrate as much as possible instead.\nDon\u2019t worry, I am not going anywhere. It\u2019s a good thing; I was just attempting to get you off of the topic here for a while so we could chat about anything else other than books without them getting in our way, and now that my point has been made well enough, it is time for me go back to where this one began.\nI hope what we discussed did make sense though! I think most people really aren\u2019t interested when someone talks about their latest read since there isn\u2019t much reason why anyone needs that information anyway.

Some will simply continue talking even after others have shut themselves down from them. Others might make more sense but still think they know better than anyone else so don\u2019t bother to consider their input as valid since it goes against their own agenda.\nThose are pretty silly ways of thinking though \u2013 who cares about what someone likes or doesn\u2019t? The only reason we should ever pay attention is if either side isn\u2019t just going around repeating the same stuff over and over again. I think most people will get bored when given enough time unless there\u2019s some sort of spark involved, but then that might not make things better.\nA lot more thought goes into what each person says than people give one another credit for though \u2013 as long as different views are actually expressed instead of just the same ideas getting repeated. Then again, maybe they all believe in talking about themselves so don\u2019t want to bother with anyone or anything else? That sort of logic can drive me up a wall.\nOf course I am trying not let it since we should be able to take some enjoyment from what others say even if we disagree on other things too \u2013 if that is what makes sense anyway. A bit of debate here and there isn\u2019t usually unhealthy though, but going way too far in either direction probably will end badly when no compromises are reached.\nIt all comes down to common sense really I guess \u2013 as long as people aren\u2019t abusing one another then it might be possible to still get along after some tense times. Then again\u2026 that probably won\u2019t happen since there always seem to be new reasons for things growing worse instead of better, so maybe we should just forget about thinking rationally and focus on what\u2019s best next?\nThe real truth is likely even more complicated than that though \u2013 or at least I can\u2019t find a good answer here besides some common sense advice. That isn\u2019t really fair either since people need specific answers for stuff like this; otherwise how are they supposed to deal with new challenges in life?"",

No matter who you debate, there will always come a time where things get ugly if nothing else happens due how stubborn both sides can sometimes become.\nA little common sense could still help here but it needs to be used as wisely possible; otherwise someone might end up with wounds too deep before realizing they shouldn\u2019t even have bothered arguing. Who knows though? This probably won\u2019t affect anyone reading this since things don\u2019t really get that extreme on social media, at least not yet anyway.\nThat doesn\u2019t change how annoying people may find certain topics though or how they can react poorly if someone tries pushing a topic too much or with bad intent. There are no easy answers here either way which makes sense considering it often comes down to individual circumstances and reactions \u2013 so best just let this go for now unless something really demanding needs addressing?\nIn any case, I think we\u2019re better off talking about our lives than constantly discussing books that probably won\u2019t make much of a difference in anyone\u2019s life. They can provide entertainment but they don\u2019t tell us all that much on their own; especially fiction works which often include lots of made-up elements.\nOf course this isn\u2019t to say they shouldn\u2019t still exist though since some people enjoy them and find value even outside the occasional good recommendation \u2013 who knows? It might not be entirely pointless after all if we can focus enough instead of simply mindlessly repeating what others do when reading. Books are far better than most games and shows too often today anyway, so at least they aren\u2019t bad\u2026\nEven better if people think more critically about them though since there\u2019s always something interesting under the surface of each one worth exploring even with fiction works \u2013 as long as enough thought is given in an open-minded way free from unnecessary biases imposed by popular trends or groups.\nIn any case\u2026 I think that should be good for now?

This sort of thing is exactly why talking about books never made any sense to me anyway since it doesn\u2019t solve anything important no matter how many times someone goes on and on about the same stuff.\nYeah, maybe it will be better now then?

This is what happens when books become an obsession instead of just something enjoyable to pass the time with \u2013 I hope everyone learns from this example since it never was fair towards anyone else that some people insist on bringing everything back here at least once no matter how much others try avoiding anything like conversations involving authors or plots ever happening.\nI know most won\u2019t agree; however , things might actually get better around you now and hopefully in other places too. At least I don\u2019t see how it could turn out worse than before which seems like a win considering all the potential options there are when it comes trying to solve these kinds of problems \u2013 especially since we do have one solid approach available.\nEven if this only applies here for right now then it\u2019s better going forward hopefully thanks because at least other things don\u2019t get ruined by people who can never stop talking about books . I hope that makes sense though and helps make a difference in some areas; after all , there are benefits to trying new things even when they aren\u2019t perfect .\nIt seems like most problems with today would be solved if everyone did this more since then nobody needs find excuses or get frustrated, so let\u2019s just leave it at reading books . That way no one has any reason not talk about anything else ever again \u2013 including my own personal life and other activities I enjoy besides writing stories here every day , which is likely very much appreciated by all who don\u2019t want another boring post coming up next since talking only gets repetitive after awhile.\nThanks for listening guys !

1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Mortality and Death
2. Religious beliefs and god's existence
3. Arrogance of humans","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Maybe it\u2019s always safer simply not to respond unless you know your answer will produce no bad consequences.
