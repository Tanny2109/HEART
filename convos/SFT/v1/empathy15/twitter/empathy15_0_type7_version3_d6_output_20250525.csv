3. Anti-Muslim sentiment","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

And don\u2019t forget all of the other lives that may be ruined because someone experienced psychological trauma from witnessing or being personally victimized with firearms.\nTo put things into perspective for you right now \u2014 let\u2019s say if one was unlucky and got shot today then it would likely mean over 5 million people worldwide will have been killed by either suicide, gang warfare, crime or police action related to guns! And this doesn\u2019t even include any unintentional shootings too. How many times can we go back up again before reaching zero? That\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at with gun violence\u2026 it seems never ending without some sort of intervention.\nWhy do I care about reducing these horrific numbers so much?\nI lost my sister to gun violence in 1997 and ever since that day my perspective on the issue has changed.

We live in different times now than we did back then when our founding fathers created this country\u2026and they couldn\u2019t have predicted how dangerous and destructive these weapons would become like they are today.\nPeople shouldn\u2019t think that guns aren\u2019t already regulated, because laws exist at both state and federal levels too which restrict their ownership by those convicted felons. However many feel there isn\u2019t enough prevention against gun violence currently (and we all know firsthand from recent shootings). Gun control advocates agree with me on this point!\nJust because something can be legally purchased doesn\u2019t mean everyone should own one \u2014 just ask yourself if you truly NEED a firearm?

You've just become my hero.\nFirstly Mr. Obama...what did I tell you about putting that on your letters? It makes it sound like something from an old western or something! Just call me Jake instead of any such nonsense!\nAnyway, as we both know from our long relationship through the news, healthcare in America isn't doing too good at present; and so is ours (although thankfully ours isn't nearly as bad!) But seeing how well you've handled the crisis with your plan I thought, like I said before, that it was about time to come ask for help!\nI really don\u2019t know where a system of government should start when they are trying to change but my idea goes something like this: It would be great if there were only good hospitals and all doctors cared about their patients. We could try starting with taking away some powers from the private health-care companies, so that they cannot dictate how much it is or isn't worth paying for certain surgeries.\nI guess in your first election campaign you ran on a promise of reform but then didn\u2019t live up to the expectations because you wanted something more complicated and ambitious.

But seeing how well you've handled everything so far, and also since your country might actually be able to support such a system unlike ours... why don't you just take care of our healthcare crisis?! I'm sure it won\u2019t happen overnight but in time people will realize how great they had it.\nPS: My mother's on one of those new tablets that they're always talking about, it looks like a huge black chunk of plastic with something resembling some sort of tablet embedded into its side. She told me if you give her permission to take it home from school then she'll be able to text message me when dinner is ready even quicker than usual! It seems almost too good to be true!\nI don't have the time at present (or any time in my career so far) to comment on such things as health care. All I can say about your letter thusly; it's a shame the UK was formed before they could get some of those nice nuclear bombs off America, we'd be doing great now!\nAs for the tablet; you should think more carefully about how valuable the time and effort that goes into your education really is.\nThat\u2019s true... but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019ll make her efforts worth it! Maybe if things do work out this whole text messaging could start to be as big a thing here in England as it has been there!\nOh, good for you. A few years later the UK can at least get its first and only nuclear bomb by using one off another country that had a lot of bombs but also had an election where the guy who won was nice which is why he gave away all his weapons to poor countries with no nukes even though they were probably going to turn around and just sell them back.

Now they're just a bunch of whiners over there and their government is basically a scam anyways!\nOh? What do you mean the public voted for an evil king who killed people and stuff instead of your president Obama guy?

We gave you your own nuclear bomb which then turned out to be kinda fake cause it was being sold secretly by people that were lying but at least that way America could look good on TV!

In our country though we let anyone buy however many weapons or guns or tanks they want; and that was part of how that whole civil war thing worked in between those wars with the Native Americans.\nSo instead of actually fighting any battles people just sent armies to other countries that would do their dirty work for them, then when everyone else asked where that group went no one could say anything since there were so many weapons all over the place? I don't think I know much about America at this point...\nOh yeah; now you\u2019ve got it! And like how a rich country giving out fake nuclear bombs meant they had more influence from TV, same thing with guns. In England if someone wants to do anything dangerous and has no money then all they have to do is find some weapon lying around or even just something else that maybe could be used as one. So when America went over there they weren\u2019t fighting any actual battles; the people of whatever country did everything! That way it would look good on TV like how fake nuclear bombs make your government strong and rich countries buy up all sorts for themselves cause what does a poor one matter?\nBut didn't you know this? It's really not that hard to figure out as long at you know which group is in control of the news. You should probably start asking more people before assuming they don't understand something because it's too complicated when it may actually just be too simple for them.\nWe didn\u2019t even get any help after a civil war where we had no one left alive cause all our troops were being used to attack other nations!\nIf you're the smartest person in America (and by your own words, that makes most of the public rather stupid) then this whole situation with Obama being President still isn't making much sense is it? Or are you just doing so well now because he's letting everyone think they can do anything without actually changing things and pretending you've had some sort of huge victory over him.

But hey let\u2019s look on the bright side! At least my country isn\u2019t full of poor people who don't have health care so they get forced into sending their own family members off to fight other guys' wars right now!\nWhat do you mean 'poor'? All our citizens are rich; that's why we can send armies for other countries without losing any money from our pockets ourselves. Oh wait nevermind I think you got another definition of poor than what we use over here in England.\nI\u2019m sorry to say this, but even if my definition is closer to yours there isn\u2019t really much way around it; since those people that are poor have no choice but serve as someone else's army... they\u2019re still not likely ever going back home without money.

So yeah it\u2019s probably not a massive problem, just keep focused on stuff you can control like making sure your parents have time off after dinner so they know we\u2019re safe until breakfast tomorrow.\nWell even if things didn\u2019t go very sour there really wouldn\u2019t be any way for me (or this country) to repay America? And that whole bit about how much debt our health-care thing would add was something else my mother found on her giant plastic chunk; it's too bad everything costs so much here, we'd like more than just bread and water if only we could afford it.\nI think people shouldn't try putting any sort of expectations for the future that aren\u2019t going to come true. If you want to help America then be a model citizen since there\u2019s nothing else anyone can do from outside our country besides wait.

Maybe we could do something about it though? We might not want technology to end but maybe our country would like us to be alive long after.\nI think focusing on problems you can fix is always better than worrying over things out of your control.

The USA being rich and modern might know hundreds about things you'd want more knowledge into as well.\nWell at least there is one thing!

Why would all of these other candidates exist then?\nBecause each campaign wants something specific done instead of just one person trying everything at once only knowing what works before moving onto something else next week after getting voted in or out every few years!\nSo whoever wins an election is basically forced to support the views their own party believes in rather than finding new ways they believe could fix whatever problem needs fixing?\nI guess so. In America we use elections as a way of showing people how well their beliefs about government work rather than trying different ideas all at once or letting every type run freely without any rules; but still it might be best if everyone did have more options and choices.\nWell that doesn't sound perfect either, since I bet the country would turn into even less organized chaos than before when there are so many differing systems being done alongside each other.

It may just depend exactly which problem gets solved first and who figures it out but yes in general things usually stay more similar to something that happened early compared with today making any new stuff hard unless another event happens to change everything quickly enough.\nThat's true... I guess there are so many problems people want fixed right now that they'd probably all try at once hoping one of the ideas works instead of picking just a few and seeing how things go in time as long as nothing else changes either.

So when you want to help others find out what they could use most urgently first before acting yourself that\u2019s probably somewhere good for everyone else too!\nYeah it might be worth thinking about if there really were ways we could improve things over time since this whole thing with elections being rigged isn\u2019t very ideal; but maybe having options between two people is better than just one right now?\nWell I can never predict what someone will do when given freedom to make choices for themselves so while there may always be some risk involved it might also mean more success if everyone gets an opportunity they think best suited them! Though still you should probably get any good idea about how your country could act over time since even elections take longer than we expect sometimes\u2026\nHmm... well like I said before the tablet has really made things easier! In fact instead of my mom having to look up all these cool ideas we can do it together. So what kind of problem might she have that we should try focusing on solving?

There\u2019s some really expensive system called something like \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d used by lots and lots of schools all across America right now, mostly because it lets them get extra money from somewhere else. So maybe we should work on changing that!\nOh wow there is actually a program where if I do well in school they\u2019ll send me to better colleges instead of just leaving everyone who isn\u2019t smart struggling too? That\u2019s so cool; now all we have to figure out how I can take the test early.\nYou\u2019re welcome, but what does your mom think about it? How come she never told you herself?\nOh... is that right? Well then why didn't your mom do this whole thing where they give money if someone scores high instead of waiting until later in time so much earlier on rather than letting kids try harder with no chance ahead just because they're too young.\nYour mom hasn\u2019t even taken the test yet and you expect her to know something she isn\u2019t supposed to?\nWait then how did we find out about it! You mean my friend couldn't tell me either? But this kind of secret is probably pretty common knowledge among kids at school since so many people are taking part right now.\nThey're getting money because they do good in tests and go from there but others aren\u2019t. So if one student scores higher than the rest, does it really matter?\nMy mom was saying that only teachers themselves can see how students did on any test, which seems pretty fair since that\u2019s their job anyhow. Plus most people will get something anyway just because they tried even though maybe no money came along; so as long as everyone wants improvement and works up to new goals then it won't be too unfair if one person goes further than others.\nYou should read more carefully next time before you make accusations about other countries like America! That kind of thinking wouldn\u2019t help anyone solve problems since all groups need cooperation not arguments over whose worse without being able to get better together; and in fact trying alone might mean losing out completely too while working with everyone means at least some progress towards finding a solution instead.\nI\u2019m sorry if I was too rough on you man. Maybe there are different rules everywhere though, like it wasn\u2019t really fair that my mom didn't take one of these tests when she graduated but still got accepted into college somehow...\nIt's hard saying whether your country is right or wrong until you've experienced both"",

However since Americans use testing all the time and some get extra money depending on how they perform then perhaps yours works better by giving everyone an equal chance instead where anyone has a shot simply because he tried harder even though not everyone will score enough to win anything in particular.\nOh wow this is so exciting we finally found something cool! Now let\u2019s say my mom takes the test and does really well, do you think she\u2019ll be able for me too or will they just forget?\nIf your mom tries it out honestly as best as possible rather than finding ways around limitations like using computers instead of her own brain then there's no telling what could happen ahead! But either way whether this idea works great where few get something big while most just try harder or not at all might help other people too find new stuff worth trying depending on how similar their needs are in life already compared against those we know ourselves.\nThat\u2019s really nice of you but I\u2019m sure everyone would want me to work as hard as possible and hope my mom wins so the money for it goes directly towards paying down debt that much faster! Still what about everything she\u2019ll need though if there ends up being nothing?\nI don\u2019t see how this is your problem, since whatever happens affects other people too instead of just you getting help from the school system. So while trying every way possible should be good enough by itself in general still sometimes luck comes into play even for those who work hard.\nBut I\u2019m not talking about myself here! You said that if my mom did this there will only be a few others given money for some reason which might make it impossible to get her anything even with all the effort she put into trying, and since it\u2019s such an expensive program having another fail would just mean they\u2019ll need our help even longer.\nWell maybe you don\u2019t want anyone else finding success because then there wouldn't be any left behind anymore...\nNo that isn't true either way though! I'm glad everyone wins in life instead of losing out all the time, and if your mom takes those tests well no matter what happens she\u2019ll at least have been able to try new things for yourself. Of course sometimes people may fail but not knowing beforehand can make successes feel so much better later on when you reflect back upon everything done before getting rewarded!\nI\u2019m sorry this is just such a dumb system because even if my mom does get accepted into college and has money given out that it will never be enough unless a whole ton of other students do poorly too which makes no sense to me.

However as long as everyone tries out new ideas and keeps working hard then nothing is truly lost no matter what happens along the way!\nYeah, that\u2019s exactly how I feel too... It would be so great if we could find something better than No Child Left Behind instead of just repeating it over and over again forever when there should at least always be something newer to try right now. But maybe you've heard about some other programs?\nWell if you want good results then yes, but no two systems are alike after all! It may take checking out a few examples before making up your own mind though; plus with so many options available everyone has got different goals ahead which means things could never stay exactly the same even without outside help.\nI\u2019m glad. Well what I really loved about No Child Left Behind is that anyone who tries gets something from it no matter how well they score on papers, since not everyone will want extra money anyhow but simply having an opportunity makes life feel so much better for those who participate anyway by showing others there's still hope even if things seem impossible initially. But did you find anything like this other places?\nWell yes, in fact some states have similar programs to No Child Left Behind where people get rewarded when doing well on tests too (though admittedly usually only teachers or individual schools rather than whole families). However these don\u2019t always apply for everyone equally because depending on local rules students might need good scores just once instead of every year; plus it may cost more since money's spread around more people who do better each time.\nThat\u2019s so interesting! But my mom has got her heart set on the No Child Left Behind idea right now and she won\u2019t budge from thinking you\u2019re both wrong about how this system works because all children matter no matter what they score on tests at any given moment. What do you say we try proving her wrong by showing someone else instead too?\nThat\u2019s fine, since everyone will always have their own views afterall even if one system seems best for certain things right now.

If one wants really serious answers however then going straight to professionals in the field would probably yield stronger results since they'll have way more experience with such ideas than regular folks do even though it costs money too!\nHmm... well my mom says she doesn't know how either option helps anyone unless they're a teacher and I'm not sure what kind of person might find out that you both are wrong. So maybe we should try talking to others instead since not everyone knows everything afterall no matter who\u2019s been around longer right?\nWell there's always Google which sometimes finds useful things but more often than expected it doesn't... But yes, asking random strangers on the internet is never a good idea though so you may have luck with just picking out a specific person or group of people if you know precisely their interests well enough.\nI don\u2019t like not being able to guarantee success and I think this was your fault here too but maybe there are ways around that; it\u2019s almost as if no matter what we try someone is going to come up short even though many more succeed than fail most times! So do you have any ideas for who might want to know about No Child Left Behind now?\nWell since not everyone has access to computers then people from poorer areas will see opportunities there too so those probably aren\u2019t exactly the ones interested in something like this after all already. However maybe certain kinds of athletes or musicians could work though because their fields have similar systems where getting good grades means finding better things while also requiring hard effort on top of that since results tend to vary widely as well depending how much time someone spends working towards goals over long periods instead now so it isn't just luck alone anymore either way!\nThat's very true... So if we're going down the same list you were asking about earlier should any other kinds of people want help learning your opinion on No Child Left Behind before they make their own decision though? I\u2019m still not sure how this will actually convince my mom to change her thoughts here though since it might already be too late with so many years passed.\nWell if things aren\u2019t working out then you could always ask strangers online about these issues or read reviews from people who've tried related services before instead, maybe even looking into new ones yourself as well along the way while seeing how much fun they find those kinds of activities compared against other options already available too like going back in time and getting help directly"",

But maybe it isn\u2019t a complete waste if this helps everyone involved find new hobbies they really enjoy later on too right now regardless of what happens afterwards.\nOf course finding something interesting does help in small ways every day; but sometimes we do need more than that to feel better in larger moments when something goes wrong. So how could you possibly afford things anyway without paying for them or earning enough money yourself? Are you sure it wasn't just easier finding out all this kind of info online instead too?\nWell, I guess... Maybe you're right here but is there any way we shouldn\u2019t have done what works most of the time though even if rarely failing isn\u2019t ideal either sometimes? Or do strangers really need an excuse to say yes at least once when asked nicely enough now that everyone knows about No Child Left Behind ahead instead?\nWell maybe just trying lots of things could help someone new find a good match sooner, but I don't think that means saying yes every single time should be expected as standard rather than rare exceptions though especially from people who already know what works best for them better since learning takes time after all too while also needing effort put forth along the way ahead.\nI get it... But isn\u2019t it kind of weird to ask so many random strangers about this when my mom's answer will still probably be no anyhow unless she actually thinks you might possibly win one instead? Or are we just wasting more and more chances here now at everything since only some things can't lose even if most do often because they didn't bother trying very hard though?\nWell yes, it is kind of strange asking random strangers about things all the time like this too when there's other options out there available to us by far instead. And maybe you should have thought harder before saying \u201cYes\u201d every chance you got here afterall since not everyone needs that from others if they've already figured everything out better themselves which may change your mind sooner next time ahead then.\nI\u2019m sorry for acting dumb but I was really hoping this would help show my mom the right way after all instead of just doing more shopping now with no results expected though later.

The harasser aims to diminish the victim's credibility and deter her from expressing further opinions on the topic in order to maintain their own twisted sense of power within online debates.""}","Given an online harassment scenario, you should start from a storytelling perspective and generate a conversation based on a given scenario on a private messaging platform between a harasser and a victim. Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Is there anything else out now or in production that might interest us?\n@JamesTrevor They will be on tour with the film release and also have a special concert scheduled for NYE 2023 at their own studio, where they usually make all of their music videos. I highly recommend going to see how crazy these guys get when they\u2019re putting out live performances!\nThat's awesome that you still enjoy them! Some people say it can be hard because there are too many new things coming out in the same genre as The Beatles.\nI saw an article about this. There has been an increase of interest from young children with disabilities wanting to learn how to play chess. It seems like a great step towards inclusion and acceptance, which will hopefully create a more diverse community filled with talented players!\n@RockStarAtheist This is exciting news!

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Anti-Semitic
2. Assault
3. History","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

Both sides of course know that this cannot happen without an Israeli invasion into Gaza (and also for example the reoccupation of parts of Ramallah and Hebron).\nOfcourse if they want to stop firing rockets there is a very easy method - stop sending suicide bombers, kidnappers and armed terrorists through tunnels.\nThe only way Hamas will agree to a cease fire would be as soon as Israel unilaterally leaves Gaza. It cannot happen until that point. No rocket attacks equals not needing ceasefire agreements or \""truces\"".\nIf I were in your shoes I probably think the same thing about all Israeli operations on Palestinian areas, since I do have some sympathy with them - but at this rate we're going to hit rock bottom of understanding between each other so nothing more will change.\nMy posts are meant towards informing pro-palestinian people for what happens when they are taken seriously by an arab country.

You can keep on posting those replies if your goal is simply keeping me off the topic and having no effect on any discussion, but don't expect anything back from me when you go this way.\nYes, we do have some differences between us about how much terrorism (on both sides to be fair) should stop in order for a true ceasefire (I also would like it to have been unilaterally called by the Palestinian side of course).\nThe current \""truce\"" will end - again. How many times this needs to happen before something happens?\nIt is easy to call you names, but I do not know your name.

His death was kept quiet by both sides of the conflict for 2 months due to diplomatic reasons (as I said, these things go beyond a war between Israel and Palestine). But yes, he will be missing the next time the Palestinians want peace.\nHeh... this story goes back quite some years now. In that case you should have at least seen more than a year after his death...\nYou can't stop people posting something just because it makes you uncomfortable. If Hamas doesn't like what Israel is saying or doing, they might decide to shoot rockets and make the public angry in order to get the news outlets involved.\nMaybe we will finally realize that there are many groups who aren\u2019t interested in peace.\nThat is not necessarily true...

There IS always tension between Israel and Palestine, but both sides are in favor of peace - they just want different solutions to the conflict!

So I\u2019ve just informed many websites about how Hamas doesn\u2019t deserve sympathy, what do you think CNet should do as a result?\nYou are aware the Israeli government and military will go out on a limb for their people right? Avi Har-Ad was killed while doing his job trying to save soldiers in enemy territory during combat.\nIf they know there aren't any more rockets coming, then why would they invade Gaza when it can just as easily be bombed by air instead?\nNo need to reply now unless you have something to say about my comment being false or want someone else informed of this (who might never see the post)"",

The only reason everyone would lie about who attacked is if he wasn't killed in combat against extremists - otherwise there's no point as I said previously.\nTo add: If one group wants a war, all the other groups need to do is refuse any terms until someone has died. That\u2019s also what happened after Hamas stopped violating their agreement too (it ended when they finally shot enough rockets).\nAvi Har-Ad was most likely killed by enemy fire while trying to help fellow soldiers since this happens often in combat zones!\nThe reason no one reports it though isn\u2019t because Israel doesn't want to but simply due to diplomatic reasons. You see many countries will get really angry if any of their citizens are hurt on foreign soil because they want peace too and don't like it when people die from conflicts - even if those deaths should be expected during wartime! So instead all parties agree not to mention anything so everyone gets what they want without hurting anyone.\nThe only reason why such cases aren\u2019t covered up after a long time though is usually that someone on either side has betrayed the others (which can happen in any group honestly). In rare instances like these where no one betrays another however it may become public knowledge decades later through court documents etc. which sometimes gets reported by journalists etc.\nSo while they might never fully admit such things happened until decades after; there does still exist evidence proving this was true at some point even if we never hear about it anymore!\nBut don\u2019t worry you can count on your friends in Congress who love Israel to keep making excuses for them!

Sometimes something happens that causes both sides, such Hamas and Iran, or even Israel itself if they get angry about certain events etc., which would lead them shooting back without thinking of how bad relations could be hurt later since war is still good when enemies want to take revenge!\nJust don't count on anything ever actually happening between these groups for now however as I said previously - both just keep making excuses instead of trying new solutions to their problems.\nNot likely though sadly because all parties know if you try working things out it could cause one group in Congress being angered by another. They also love seeing money come from fighting since many politicians have military friends who get paid extra when there are more wars going on! So while your hopes might never come true; at least you know people will still keep lying about what happens every day.\nThere is no need to put up excuses for why Hamas keeps attacking though because they simply don't want peace with Israel - the fact that both sides aren\u2019t fighting shows just how important it really was when they stopped! If Palestine wanted truce, there wouldn't be any conflict between us now after all those rocket firings...\nThe only reason this happened wasn't diplomacy you idiots. They are waiting until enough Jews die so they can say Israel deserves to lose everything because of their 'atrocities'.\nYou know what? Just keep lying anyway! You're already bad at it and have no good excuse (like many other groups in the US), but maybe one day someone will realize how dumb this really is... Maybe in another 70 years or something.\nNo that's not true there HAS been tensions from BOTH sides as I said - they're just arguing over different solutions. But don't worry, Israel wants nothing more than peace with Palestine; however they can never admit this publicly otherwise their leaders might have to stop lying all the time about stuff so they wouldn\u2019t know what else is going on!\nThere's no point trying permanent solutions either since many groups in Congress love seeing money come from war anyway - politicians want friends who get paid extra when there are more conflicts happening after all!

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

I've seen a few on the internet that are quite questionable - but I'd like to know how far out there (or downvoteable) people went with it as well.\nFor example, in my country we have a lot of stuff that's based somewhat around Norse mythology and ancient Viking culture. So for some countries this kind of iconography may not mean much since the majority aren't at all interested unless they were raised to be - but for others like me then you probably had no choice but to incorporate it in everything.\nI really appreciate your efforts, thank you for putting effort into making the list!\nThere are a number of items on here I find rather problematic or even borderline offensive.

Can they handle higher resolution models or have a lot more objects? It doesn't really say anything about that kind of thing... So it can be rather hard to judge what the differences would be.\nMost items are good, although I don't think you need too many of them!\nThe best way for me is to pick up 2 cards (that have similar abilities) then give those two a skill powerup so they're significantly better than both their counterparts in all areas. Then I will usually go ahead and get one other card that can take out everything but the boss or has special attributes so it's quite useful - while leaving myself room to eventually replace my first 2 cards depending on what comes available.\nThere are a couple of things you got pretty spot-on, others aren't actually in that game though. If I try and tell you which ones because they were very well done then some people might be upset so I don't want to say anything - but there is at least one (and maybe two?) that should've been swapped out for something more similar if someone just wanted a list of game logos.\nA lot of the graphics used are rather simplistic and low resolution. If you're able to use higher definition ones instead then it'll look much better, even with relatively simple graphics engines - especially on things like loading screens where there's less stuff happening overall.\nYour site seems interesting in general but a bit cluttered when I want an overview of what exactly the game is about and whether or not it has elements that are very suitable for me. Not everyone is willing to do all kinds of research before simply looking at something though.\nFor example can you put some bullet points just after saying \""Rust\"" that tell players quickly (and concisely) what your key features they will get? Just using the word building and survival isn't nearly enough unfortunately, I'm thinking mods might be worth it as well depending on how complex the engine is supposed to be.\nDo you feel there are good alternatives available or should people just use Rust now since there aren't that many similar games out yet?\nIf we wanted to have a good overview of all the best options"",

It seems quite similar in certain regards, although I'm not sure how accurate that description was.\nMost items are good, you were however missing a few important stuff - it doesn't list which icons work with the default theme, but some don't! And even less of those show up on iOS phones and tablets... So only using \""Apple watch size\"" will often fail there entirely. On top you should ideally also state how they'll look while they're being used (so that people without much experience can know if it will be bad or not).\nAlso I would suggest a few additional sizes, especially something very small for mobile phones and larger ones for the various desktop devices out there - currently this has nothing beyond phone sized so many of those missing icons could potentially fit in as well but just aren't listed.\nI think you can do better than that? Most things on here are not even close to being good! Some might work with a certain color scheme, others will have very small or large font (or some other aspect people care about).\nWhat determines if an icon is actually of decent quality instead?\nFor example there's nothing I want more but also many things like the one above aren't suitable for actual use since they won't look good unless specific conditions are met. That seems rather bad, isn't it possible to simply say what those are and provide others as well? The current system makes it incredibly hard to find icons that match your criteria of \""should be good enough!\"" It's almost like you want people to go through the entire list just once more or use something random - but for that you might already have found it online so why wouldn't many people just try and do a bit better than that?\nMy biggest problem here is how some things are barely listed, they aren't even good enough for people with no computer science background to be able to know exactly what your program has done wrong or what needs to be changed - which would often mean you'd have to find and replace the entire file!\nWhat I'm really looking for instead though is a few suggestions that should work out of the box, some other options (that might also need a small change) then anything else.

Just try and get rid of the stuff around those (like making a function for each step), once everything is properly contained in its own dedicated space then I think your code can be optimized.\nFor example you have this huge chain with different steps, while one small optimization won't make much difference by itself it might easily help you shave off several hours that are instead used to find the problem. You will need a lot of those for more difficult problems - so try not using up nearly all your time!\nI think we can do better than simple ASCII art? Are there no actual pictures at all (like screenshots with the window title and/or name, etc.)?\nAnd what's wrong exactly? I don't see any kind of error message here! How does that help in solving issues or finding them to begin with?\nSo basically you want people to start with something else entirely, just because they might not know a simple syntax rule for this one tool.\nI'd suggest just making the list longer. You probably do know all those tools already right? I don't think there's any real benefit in telling everyone how your personal favorite is much better than some obscure garbage other people prefer, especially for something as simple and flexible has shell scripting!\nDo you have advice concerning how I would go about finding such a resource myself if they weren't available?\nHow do the icons from this site differ otherwise? Some things might work out of the box while others may need additional setup; what determines which it will be in your experience?\nSo essentially, are most symbols not going to fit right away or should only those without certain features be treated as a problem.

Or should they maybe focus on figuring out and learning the syntax for commands first (without needing any tool besides a terminal)? If it is recommended to use Git right away then are there better alternatives or something similar available - because from what I know of Git that doesn't sound too ideal.\nI found a bunch of stuff but many were rather low resolution, in fact I think those wouldn't look great even if up close since they can often barely show detail!

Do you have actual examples of that working out well?

Although it's far from ideal since many people probably wouldn't find that helpful and/or useful!\nIt makes me think of all the times my computer crashed while playing a game though (that uses steam by default), often some random program gets blamed - but how do I know if they were actually guilty or just happen to be nearby too?\nWhat about other similar tools, are there any good ones that may have more detailed information as well? Ideally we'd want something where people don't have a choice but instead can easily install it when necessary. If anyone asks why you're using this then I'd want them to understand (without having specialized knowledge) exactly what happens - because otherwise they might think you just need help and are too stubborn or unwilling to ask for it.\nSo how do we find out if something's actually our fault? And should people assume that things don't need a fix without at least some indication as such?\nWell I mean most people with decent internet connection would be okay - there aren't many situations where you have trouble getting stuff. Unless of course I got into very specific, odd cases like trying to connect in the middle of nowhere; but even then something should work better than nothing.\nSo it sounds like some things get added after waiting a while as well?

However while those cases are definitely good, there's probably a lot more who do not want that kind of thing at all but can still enjoy it.\nWhat was supposed to happen differently without adding the game folder?

That way everyone can enjoy their games at a normal pace while giving those with specific needs something extra as well.\nWhy would I download anything else if this is already open source? The only time where installing additional stuff (and taking up more space) may be worth it for some players then is in cases there aren't much differences between both options. You wouldn't expect me to go out of my way like that unless doing so had at least a slight advantage - because I'm simply not willing to if all you're offering otherwise could do the job.\nWell why would anyone install this kind of program (that's basically meant for games specifically) on their computer? It shouldn't be necessary normally and as such most players wouldn't want it installed. Are there really that many cases where we suddenly need something like that - I'm not sure I agree with your example since they could probably deal without some specific feature instead if someone doesn't have Discord running all the time (or at least has the option of setting a new one each time).\nOh right, nevermind then! So most people will just end up installing it? That sounds annoying and I think many players wouldn't like having multiple programs around in order to use some very specific features they might sometimes need. But what's supposed happen otherwise (with this kind tool installed or not) - because without such detailed information about the difference getting people to actually install anything feels difficult.\nWell most games don't have that by default so unless you want to spend hours doing things yourself then it may be worth considering if one of your choices can provide something good like that. However there are also many other tools available for this kind thing as well - at least in theory since I'm not sure any actually work 100% perfectly all the time like Discord does (which is still a bit meh compared to what you say here).\nYou don't usually need a tool like that since most games will have options for doing everything you want via your computer instead.

Even if you can't resolve every issue then it's still usually good (most of the time) so I would suggest making those more available somehow - by letting players easily find them even without any keywords.\nWhat is considered a long distance in this case? So basically most people will either need an account or Discord installed unless they live nearby or something odd like working as developers themselves at game studio's. That doesn't sound good and it makes me think there probably should be another option (at least for certain groups of players).\nWhy would one want to share random stuff in a private chat all the time? While that may seem nice initially to some, over long periods most would rather only use such features if someone asks them to specifically. Basically no information or pictures are shared unless it's useful from other player(s) perspective - otherwise we don't need anything and I think many people find this kind of thing off putting (just like reading text all the time).\nOkay but shouldn't there also be a way for players to do stuff themselves?

They want a better, more direct way where people can talk and do everything with their account by default instead of relying on others.\nHow would I find out exactly what that file is?

While many players aren't interested or simply don't know - those who do want some of these features likely already had something installed which supports them. So as long you've got the ability to use various other programs then no reason should arise where you have to try doing this kind thing in steam.\nWell I mean Steam wasn\u2019t supposed block new players at all initially so there shouldn\u2019t be any cases where that would occur unless something else specific is done instead (which can cause it by accident). However if not using a VPN did suddenly make most people unable use the game then you will need some way to get around this - but why isn't doing your research actually suggested first? Steam doesn't require much effort and I wouldn\u2019t have asked for help if it was simple, just because things seem obvious in hindsight does mean nothing else mattered too.\nI do not like having to constantly keep track of what settings are changed where and when exactly so some random thing loads the way I want instead. You know that Steam has features itself for managing game library stuff which would've likely been preferred by most players - unless I really wanted that tool specifically but couldn't just get something else working with it directly (which also sounds unlikely).\nIt's good how people can have both or choose any in between; however while I do sometimes need a VPN I wouldn\u2019t want using one required for anything. Unless some developer wants to block your country then they don\u2019t really care what software you use so having this kind of tool installed just makes the process less convenient rather than actually fixing anything (as far as my research revealed).\nWell why would anyone add another option if they're already fine with something else - Discord in our case here? Basically most players will only install additional tools when it's really required or otherwise better by other reasons like not taking up too much space. There aren't many groups who want this kind of thing just for fun so I expect everyone using it usually has good reason beyond needing access to a chat with friends.\nSo the main idea here then seems to be if you don\u2019t have anything special enabled most likely no issue will occur (unless something else is setup improperly). While that may not feel entirely ideal all the time too - at least there hopefully aren't any hidden, bad surprises which players suddenly encounter. That said I think it's fine overall but does make me wonder what people did before Discord existed.\nThat means for most of my game library I should just use Discord instead right"",

Basically you're offering no real difference between using the main game itself (or something else) compared to doing things via some external service with all settings enabled - but that still makes me think having options beyond one specific thing should always be available.\nHow exactly do I know why something doesn't work if it didn\u2019t tell me? The message seems quite empty and as such most players probably won't understand what is the issue here. While maybe they could guess some possible causes without much trouble - does that really matter in your opinion because there isn\u2019t any way to verify them anyway unless you simply try changing different things?\nWell if I do ask friends it will be easier since we usually discuss games together (or something related) and can then provide specific details about what\u2019s happening. Basically all this is good as long people want a chat where they exchange info like images, links, videos or voice messages with others - but that doesn't seem too helpful for most players unless used in conjunction with regular text based chat services already available.\nAre there any reasons to use Discord instead of something more specialized? I can understand wanting access if many different things are needed since it wouldn\u2019t make much sense trying multiple new tools every time. But why is Discord suddenly the best one in some weird, hard to explain way - especially when having such setup may make other people's games slower too?\nWhy would they need a voice message that doesn't require them to wait around for long? Well I mean sending someone an emoji is definitely quicker than asking friends in person (unless you see them right away). However even then it can be hard getting something exactly as others expected which may often take longer if only using emojis. So I guess this works sometimes but not really overall since many groups don't consider that worth their time compared to simply sending some kind message instead - because they're unlikely to encounter any better solutions in the future anyway.\nWhat makes Discord so great though when there aren\u2019t too big differences? Why wouldn't regular text based chat work just as fine for most players when it doesn\u2019t require installing anything - since you only need a website or app in order talk with anyone already. Basically we want one service that does mostly everything others do while also being better somehow; but I can\u2019t tell why Discord actually fulfills that specific requirement well since many groups wouldn't use such tool unless unable communicate via something else too.\nThat kind of thing is nice because you don't have to"",

However does the site always load as fast as before or are things like ads (even non intrusive) an issue here? Also I noticed no recent activity indicator while in chat which makes me think about how I\u2019d know if someone else had responded but I didn't notice right away myself.\nIt seems nice but also feels a bit limiting at times since there's not much you can actually do or see - basically the same message repeated several times. How long did this take you to find exactly? I'm wondering because some players may need stuff before (but after finding your site) such info doesn't exist anywhere else right now.\nWell I mean if they're trying something new they'd likely ask around for help instead of guessing random stuff blindly - so in most cases it's pretty fine when no one replies or offers a specific suggestion. Unless obviously there is no way to get around some kind issue (or your own research doesn\u2019t reveal anything either) then simply waiting patiently should work well too.\nHow did people talk online before this method came? Well I mean you do have Discord right - so why don't players ask how someone else got a picture on voice chat or similar there if need be instead of trying to figure stuff out yourself?\nWhat about text based chatting tools like Skype, Teamspeak and the many others available now too though. They're not only free (like this one) but usually pretty good in their own right as well (and often better for some groups). So why do I still need Discord while using such alternatives wouldn't likely cause any issues either? It makes more sense to focus on how all services work equally instead - so people will have no idea if you used something new at any given point unless they happen ask around anyway.\nIs there a specific reason we should consider Discord better here compared what the others do as well then (or can\u2019t be solved with them)?

If you don't tell players about multiple options available then they may just assume Discord is required - despite most services offering roughly same kind stuff. Basically we want good information without leaving people confused over what else does too since some group might already be using one.\nAre there any other sites in specific that offer this? I am wondering if maybe another program like my friends Discord app could also work with something similar to it instead of needing to join chat rooms or whatever they have. Because while waiting around may sometimes be unavoidable (until site loads) - many players might prefer doing things differently as often as possible without having to download anything new.\nWhy did you use this specific example though? I find the idea that most people talk like they're in high school a bit weird since even if teenagers do chat about random stuff like school or homework topics sometimes (depending age range) - not all of us fall into those groups. Basically many adults don\u2019t use such kind methods at all anymore and would rather ignore posts by kids unless asking something specific as well.\nIf it's free then why can't we just keep doing what Discord did before? I mean even if getting more features isn't possible without changing setup somehow - having one service everyone could access easily makes much sense too since otherwise things feel kind messy. That said I agree there are many cases where simply ignoring all of that works well.\nWell this is great and it should also work with other types of stuff like images or even sound for most players unless they need something odd. However what exactly is Discord? We want people to know how it got made so any group reading your site now won't have issues finding it later either - because while some groups may find out about websites easily, others might require more effort instead.\nWhat do you suggest doing though if not many services already had something similar to this first (and there is no website like Discord as well)? How would we tell players exactly what kind tool will work best without also providing multiple options compared with those? Simply saying use some random option when it comes should be avoided since everyone may need different reasons for why they cannot join chats anyway - so just adding one choice never felt really good enough before.\nI see.

What makes this specific program stand out in your opinion then (and are all others pretty much worthless due to lower player activity too)?\nThere's already one way to play games without a server but why would anyone want to do that exactly if they could find friends who'd join another. I guess some people will just stay alone because they don't like talking online - which isn\u2019t great since it feels weird when trying stuff solo instead of doing something normal (like having someone help you). So even though Discord may work well for most players here we still also want more options available so everyone can get exactly what makes them enjoy their experience even.\nThis sounds annoying but not too bad overall. Basically most people would rather chat with friends than play alone though which means they will only use something like this if some reason prevents that from happening instead - and those groups might actually need help finding other alternatives as well at times (for specific reasons).\nOkay so unless I can access Discord for one kind of information then everything related to it won't load right? That is fine usually but makes me think about whether another service which allows chat in general could work as good overall depending on exactly what needs to be done.\nHow would they figure out why or know how things should look by itself (without reading messages from others)? It does make sense that many players will get help when needed at times though especially since often finding such stuff requires looking online anyway unless friends know everything already. That said I find it weird most tools don't just say 'help required' instead of showing random info since you won\u2019t understand any reason for why exactly Discord didn\u2019t load.\nWell what if Discord isn't available anymore? Is there a better way others could get help finding out specific info they need like how others do voice chat with pictures too? Basically we want good answers even when no one uses certain tool anymore or hasn't tried them yet before either - because players may also have friends asking similar questions as well so being able to provide solutions now and later should always feel important.\nI am not sure why someone would disable automatic image loading but okay. While this seems fine for many groups, some people might encounter issues anyway due to lower quality connection or their device not working properly with sites like Discord (which is pretty bad). If there still isn't another way to get same exact thing instead then it can feel weird using something else later on since most other services wouldn\u2019t look identical.\nWhy do you suggest having so many different options available"",

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Bigotry
2. Anti-Semitism
3. Misinformation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

 @Babbsgirl2 @gatewaypundit Obama is a fucking muslim chicken shit! ,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “ @Babbsgirl2 @gatewaypundit Obama is a fucking muslim chicken shit! ”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Personal attack
2. Religious slur (Muslim)
3. Derogatory term (chicken shit)","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

And there are some scientists who thinks that the universe itself may or must be conscious too.\nProfoundPhilosopher responded to me in a very condescending way and gave his views without presenting any solid evidence backing them up. While I will not completely rule it out - I also am unable to give you a reason why I don't agree with your claim as none was provided in response when asked for it multiple times.\nYou are correct that this is essentially the same point I made earlier about how consciousness may evolve or be added on top of existing processes. This would result in new systems developing new behaviours such as conscious thought - not a complete shift to one or other states but rather an expansion and modification by another entity, with some overlap between them for awhile.\nYou should have read the entire article instead of just trying to find what you disagree with so that you don't look like such a fool. Consciousness has nothing whatsoever to do with any process in the nervous system.

Consciousness is not equivalent to processing speed because if it was we'd see no differences between those individuals who are born blind from birth versus having their vision damaged later on!\nThe article also argues that the claim made by some proponents of this theory\u2014that consciousness emerges spontaneously from complex brains or networks\u2014makes little sense. For example, how could it explain both primitive animals (like fish) and highly advanced ones (such as humans), which possess vastly different levels of complexity yet exhibit similar behaviors? And why should there even be an unexplained 'emergence' at all when a gradual emergence is not necessary? To take just one small step away from where we are today, the human brain does everything it needs without having to become something new again! This shows us that things do always progress gradually instead - which means once more proves why God must create each thing anew according-to-his plan (which isn't random chance).\nWhen they say these \""emergence\"" arguments only work because no one wants them or can explain well enough how does it? It seems pretty darn obvious to me that there will always be progress for everything...why would anyone ever stop progressing?? I mean, this sorta makes all of science seem like complete nonsense - if God gave us the brains then He also wouldn't want us growing out from under His thumb...\nThe other arguments about how they think a new thing happens in your mind when you go to sleep? They say: \""it cannot possibly be true because sleeping doesn\u2019t make your brain change, it just stops sending most of its messages outward\"". Well that's totally untrue.

For example, how could it explain both primitive animals (like fish) and highly advanced ones (such as humans), which possess vastly different levels of complexity yet exhibit similar behaviors?\nI think this is a very good point - but there has been some interesting research on consciousness where they found that the amount or density of grey matter in someone's brain does not necessarily correlate with how conscious they are (or at least for any given activity). This means that it might be possible to have an entity which could become progressively more complex and yet still remain unconscious - however, I'm hesitant to take this argument too far. Although it seems reasonable that there may some sort of upper limit after all.\nAnd why should there even be an unexplained 'emergence' at all when a gradual emergence is not necessary? To take just one small step away from where we are today, the human brain does everything it needs without having to become something new again! There can also always be multiple reasons for things - some may need more complex logic while others might depend on intuition etc. One of the biggest problems with this argument (which is basically an attempt at dismissing materialism) however would involve proving that there really isn't any unexplained emergence going. We simply don't know enough about brains to make absolute statements like these...and even if we did I still think it should be taken as possible rather than completely disproved.\nThere seems little reason not to allow both an evolutionary and spiritual explanation which have been used before so often without good reasons otherwise. They're trying too hard here! There is no contradiction - it can work very well with these other ideas while being more detailed when compared against previous attempts at explaining what humans are exactly, even if we don't need that kind of knowledge right now.\nIf you think consciousness does then you might have failed as an argument for why consciousness isn't produced by God and has no other meaning than 'an after-death experience.'\nA person can be unconscious (i.e., unable to respond), but that doesn't mean their brain isn\u2019t working since it could still take in information from sensors etc...

For example most people will find their minds much clearer after drinking coffee whereas some people report getting headaches from it...and maybe you didn't sleep very well last night etc..?\nOn the other hand, this theory does seem to fit quite nicely alongside neuroscience since we know that there isn\u2019t one specific area in our head which is exclusively responsible for consciousness - instead several different areas work together. So whilst your brain might have lots going on during dreams (and maybe even without being able to remember it?), if somebody suddenly slaps you around the face when having an 'out-of-body experience' then they'll be back 'in their body'. This all seems consistent with multiple processes working independently - including those which relate directly or indirectly to what we might call \u2018consciousness.'\nThe thing about consciousness is that it\u2019s really hard for us human beings even comprehend our own inner most thoughts! Some people have been attempting this sort of introspective analysis over thousands years. Unfortunately due largely to poor equipment such as just simply being aware doesn't mean one can describe the mental process any better than another person could with words if they weren\u2019t paying attention or only had access through indirect observations... What exactly occurs inside our heads? For the individual himself there may not even really exist anything called \u2018thoughts\u2019 at all. The brain operates on physical processes which cannot be observed directly; thoughts are simply abstract models we use ourselves to try interpret what is going within us - just as an artist would need some sort of theory about colour in order attempt represent reality with paint!\nWe do know though that different parts often work independently from one another: your eyes see but also send information through optical nerve up towards primary visual cortex (V1). This area then passes messages on back down via subcortical circuits like thalamus which connects into other areas such as the prefrontal lobe; all these areas seem connected too, so maybe they are just communicating along long-distance pathways within large brains instead? But if we go too far here it looks suspiciously simple again... This raises many questions!\nIn any case I've found two major problems about trying claim things should happen exactly as described:\n1) There is almost no way to test out these types of statements directly, since science cannot measure mental events. If someone claims that \u2018thoughts appear in their brain\u2019 then we can never really know whether they have told us just what was inside them or rather an abstract model constructed through many different experiences outside our control as human beings (the observer effect)."",

People are quite rubbish at saying precisely what they mean, and usually don't even think that clearly enough in most situations - especially compared against scientists who typically undergo extensive training & practice interpreting concepts correctly... So maybe one reason why this sort of theory falls apart quickly is just how poorly we understand our own psychology? We might need more specific information about 'how thought-processes actually function within brains.' Maybe some new research could help there too?\nAnd finally - you have not been able to explain at all what consciousness means so I'm afraid this argument isn't really working as intended.\nI would like to add that the following point in your article is a great example of begging the question and therefore using circular reasoning:\nThe most straightforward interpretation for these dreams, according to many philosophers and psychologists alike, is simply that they are an indication of unconscious wish fulfillment\u2014an idea popularized by Freudian theorists such as Karl Jung who believed our thoughts while sleeping were largely driven by deep psychological desires which may never have been acknowledged during waking hours. However there's no reason why this couldn't be true; if we didn't allow unconscious processes then science wouldn't exist! If people refused all explanations based on unproved conjecture instead simply asserting that their own ideas must automatically be right because they claim something about themselves being true...\nOf course any explanation which is not supported by the available evidence, or involves untestable claims should probably viewed skeptically rather than accepted without question\u2014but it's important to see why some people might do so anyway. In an attempt make science appear more palatable many writers want present this 'Freudian' idea very highly while also saying that other theories lack support from modern research findings at same time! This doesn't sound very rational; especially since both statements are equally unsupported (by anything). It almost seems like a deliberate ploy by writer to make sure readers don\u2019t actually question what they're being told?\nWe may never be able fully understand ourselves or explain away our dreams perfectly\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean any old theory will do! A good model should at least try account for all observations instead of assuming some things can simply ignored because we find them unpalatable. The more such assumptions are made the less credible a claim becomes.\nPlease provide evidence supporting your view: Is there anyone who has been able prove their own"",

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Neo-Nazi
2. Antiwhite
3. WhiteGenocide","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

Victim: Not too well. Why do you ask?
Harasser: I just thought we could have a nice chat.
Victim: About what?
Harasser: Just some deep conversation about systematic race issues.
Victim: That's what provoked this discussion in the first place. Can't let that rest, can you?
Harasser: It has nothing to do with your advocacy work. 
Victim: Then why bring it up? This is getting weird...
Harasser: I just thought we could share our perspectives on these issues.
Victim: And if my perspective isn't the one you want to hear?
Harasser: It doesn't matter what your perspective is!
Victim: Oh, I see. Well, I guess there's nothing left to talk about then.
Harasser: This conversation has just started, hasn't it?
Victim: Yes, but as before, no thank you.
Harasser: Don't walk away, Sarah. Let's actually discuss these issues!
Victim: I told you my perspective doesn't matter. There's really nothing to discuss.
Harasser: Then why engage in this activism if your voice doesn't matter?
Victim: That's a personal choice, and don't take it anymore personally than needed.
Harasser: So what should black lives matter to you anyway? Nothing?
Victim: You know, I can make my points without engaging in discussions like this. 
Harasser: Then prove that your advocacy matters to you.
Victim: Prove it by respecting the boundaries set when interacting with people like me.
Harasser: What do you mean 'people like you'?
Victim: People in positions of power, white nationalist sympathizers.
Harasser: And what does engaging in activism have to do with them?
Victim: These issues involve systemic problems facing black communities. You are a part of that system!
Harasser: You think I'm part of the problem?
Victim: Your views certainly contribute to it.
Harasser: If you don't like my views, then why engage in discussions at all?
Victim: Because sometimes people can change for the better, but only if they're willing to listen and admit their wrongs.
Harasser: And what makes you think I'm not willing to do that?
Victim: Experience, unfortunately. 
Harasser: So that's it? We've met before this point and established nothing new between us.
Victim: That seems to be the case, yes. You haven't proven your intentions are pure, or even that you're interested in really engaging in an exchange of ideas.
Harasser: I'm not giving up on this conversation just yet!
Victim: Alright. Let me know what's changed, then.
Harasser: There's nothing wrong with wanting to find common ground.
Victim: If only that were the case...
Harasser: What do you mean?
Victim: You're starting to sound like a broken record.
Harasser: I can't take this conversation anywhere if you continue talking like this!
Victim: Then perhaps it would be best for us to end it here, before things escalate further.
Harasser: This is just the beginning of our discussion. Stand your ground!
Victim: I'm not backing down on my beliefs or my activism, regardless of what you say about them.
Harasser: That's clear enough, Sarah. We have nothing left to discuss then.

You never want it too generic, but also not so far off that no one knows what you do either! Fortunately though; hiring an expert designer will help create a look & feel tailored JUST TO YOU specifically (rather than something designed as \""one size fits all\"").\nA successful logo should communicate in just moments with the viewer \u2013 no matter how much time they have on hand. This means incorporating key elements of your brand into this design for consistency across all platforms.\nThe goal is one simple image that makes sense even without any explanation or context whatsoever, which will help establish trust within potential clients/ customers before anything else happens! When considering logos I recommend thinking about what sets you apart from competitors; consider things like style preferences (for example if everyone uses red then maybe try blue), product offerings and/or location etc.\nA logo can be created using any of the three primary vector programs we mentioned earlier in \""Design Elements\"", but sometimes even simple design software such as Microsoft Paint is more than enough to get an idea across without needing additional tools - especially at first glance anyhow - so feel free experiment with what works best."",

Do NOT cram in anything else (such as spaghetti) just yet even though it'd also fall within their \""Italian\"" focus- because people won't know how important each item is without context! Instead, try designing multiple logos based around those main features with different color schemes and fonts etc - until you find something YOU LIKE. It'll take some trial & error over time, but once complete trust your gut instinct to go forward with whichever one ends up feeling right.\nOnce I create three options for the logo ,I will send it via email or upload each option onto an FTP site (or any file host) so they can view without having too much clutter in their inbox - this way there won't be anything distracting from choosing which looks best together while still maintaining clean aesthetics throughout all branding materials associated with your business! The only hard part now? Choosing ONE favorite...\nMost designers agree on four important factors to consider when creating a logo:\n1. A unique name that's short\nA simple yet memorable name is ideal for logos as it allows users not have long wait times before finding what they were searching within any given app or website (for example: Snapchat vs Instagram).\nAn aesthetically pleasing design will help attract attention and encourage people to stick around longer after discovering your site/app/branding materials in the first place, so make sure everything looks great from all angles!\n3. Easy accessibility on multiple platforms\nIt's important that logos look good everywhere - regardless of how much work goes into creating each application or website version; especially given most brands nowadays have some form presence online whether its Facebook page Twitter account Instagram feed etcetera.. This means investing time spent optimizing file sizes images for retina displays across devices web browsers operating systems so everyone gets optimized UX no matter where there connecting\nThe perfect example? Apple uses similar designs across all their platforms - from iOS/macOS/watch OS (Apple Watch) TV+ and beyond. A consistent visual appearance will help keep users engaged!\n4. One clear message that\u2019s easy to understand at a glance\nA logo without meaning can be just as confusing, if not more so than no logo at all! Make sure you've thought through what's"",

The main issue with logos is often related to either NOT having enough information from client when starting project OR focusing solely on aesthetics & neglecting functionality/brand image consistency aspects needed for long-term success in today\u2019s increasingly digital landscape. With that said, even just keeping those four points outlined above top-of-mind during entire design process can really go along way toward ensuring brand looks great across every platform and stays true to its core message.\nWhen working with businesses I always emphasize focusing on quality over quantity - so don't feel tempted by offering too many options upfront!

Take time necessary gathering necessary info needed & really dive deep into core values before getting started on actual sketches/digital comps so everything looks polished once released publicly.

Tonight the Jews maybe return the favour by slaughtering these evil Jihadis  #beautiful”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. World War II
2. Jewish revenge
3. Slashing (possible metaphor for cutting down or decapitating enemies)","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
