2. Hair color","1. Insult
2. Ugliness
3. Appearance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

This makes for an easier connection between different parts of your pieces \u2013 keeping focus without getting lost in thought!\n2) Get Familiar with Riffs: When learning new songs, break down each part before putting everything back together again. Listen carefully; identify which pattern comes next after hearing each section several times through until its second nature.\n3} Use Props / Instruments to Help Yourself Pay Attention :"",

In addition, learning the structure (key signature) for songs ahead of time helps in figuring out what kinds of embellishments suit best each particular section or note.\nOnce these foundations are set up, improvisation can flow more naturally without being too forced or stiff sounding - like talking while you walk rather than walking first before starting conversation! This means finding different ways to add color through rhythmic variation and ornamentation such as slides between notes or hammer-on / pull-off techniques etc., whatever suits best given context of song. The idea here not just play well-known licks but create something unique yet coherent within context since improvising must make sense otherwise it feels like random notes thrown around aimlessly.\nFinally don\u2019t forget about dynamics because they\u2019re key ingredient good performance! Knowing how much dynamic range available different parts songs allows us really bring out emotions contained each individual phrase even note which ultimately contributes more compelling overall experience listeners get from hearing you play live.\u201d\nWhat are some examples of well-known solo guitarists that I can learn from?\nLearning to play the guitar alone takes dedication and practice, but there are many successful solo players who can serve as inspiration for musicians in all genres. Learning from these world-renowned performers is a great way to gain new skills and improve your technique.\nHere's some tips on how you might benefit:\n1) List the Solo Guitarists: The first step would be find some of your favorite guitarists playing alone \u2013 it\u2019s important that pick artists you enjoy so when it comes time learn they sound familiar instead of feeling overwhelmed by something completely foreign! Make sure take note what exactly about performance grabbed attention (the riffs soloing techniques etc.) This helps determine which aspect focus more during own practice sessions.\n2) Listen to Their Recordings: After having identified favorite musicians next step listening them frequently through headphones or over earphones\u2013 this allows really listen each instrument without sound being m"",

Shut up,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Shut up”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Condescending tone
3. Silencing attempt","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

It could be a fake out with one person pretending they're the sniper from class while all along it was someone else, so this is still just theory and has very low credibility.\nAhh you can't prove her death?

That someone in a police uniform (maybe a detective) should come up and start asking everyone more questions about that day, maybe they'd get an answer soon enough if someone else was hiding something and didn't want it revealed so early.\nIt doesn't matter what happened after if nobody knew he wanted revenge on his friend for killing two people at the school.

I suppose there\u2019s also always a chance that whoever they question might know why someone was so angry about their friend at school killing two people, though even then the shooter (or person acting as if) probably wouldn't explain everything fully since they haven\u2019t been given enough time.\nHe doesn't have the time if someone is already planning to take revenge on him or his brother. Not like he can sit around waiting when there might not be another chance to do anything about this whole situation in order for everyone to live and not cause trouble going forward.\nIn that case, then their only other option would probably just involve following this person more carefully to see what they do next without being too noticeable themselves until there\u2019s some opportunity or reason to confront them if needed. They'd have to make sure though because it could go either way with whether the suspect sees through them and decides not to take action out of fear while waiting for something else.\nHe's a criminal anyway after breaking into her flat, he shouldn't act shocked if anyone finds out about anything related too him.\nYes yes now that there\u2019s some possible proof. But still no matter what this doesn\u2019t all have an easy solution so instead I think they should try being sneaky and get even better at hiding their actions while spying on others since clearly if it really were a plan like suspected then whoever would be doing this knew how much attention could draw too themselves making them nervous and paranoid about someone trying to catch up with them for years.\nBut...

You can't just go saying breaking into another person's house after they're long dead is proof of being a bad person.\nI would suggest instead he should try getting better at hiding any evidence like fingerprints or DNA and keep on going with his plans as well while also considering what happens if someone does start trying to catch up with them before its too late for anyone involved if that's the case. If things aren't handled correctly then this could all backfire in a very bad way.\nThat's not something you consider to yourself, clearly he needs help from other people who have more experience doing criminal activity than just following rules and being nice even when they aren\u2019t deserved!

But it seems pretty obvious that no normal person would want to break into an apartment that they know is occupied. And now his fingerprints and DNA are all over the place which means he'll have a hard time living normally without being questioned or caught by police.\nOf course having a hard time doesn't really matter when something like this comes up, criminals usually have no problem risking their lives just to get whatever it was that they wanted (if only for short-term gains). Also if anyone does question him about why he was visiting her apartment then that person shouldn\u2019t know who killed either of them because whoever shot up the school should never have been connected with either one until now anyways.\nThey'll probably notice their dead family members and friends have something in common though... That doesn't even prove he's a criminal since they could all just be linked by working on some project together or living close to each other. And if you're going to break into someone's house then you should at least try doing so without accidentally leaving behind your DNA and fingerprints.\nIf they were connected long enough for them both to remember from where, it doesn't seem like a random chance that it would happen right after this particular incident. Plus criminals often don\u2019t care who gets hurt or caught along their path of trying something illegal since if anyone thinks too much about stopping somebody then chances are good that person might not come back alive.\nWho cares how someone got killed? Whether its your family/friends, people you barely know at all, or just complete strangers... They're all still getting murdered. Maybe instead he needs to go see the cops and have them find out some information for him if they're going through any files related to these cases right now.\nThat's never going to happen since criminals usually only go to the police after something has already gone wrong (and it takes forever). But even if he did get caught then so what? If his brother didn't go ahead and kill those two kids then maybe he wouldn\u2019t have been considered a criminal in the first place anyway which means that this whole situation was completely out of everybody's hands from the beginning!\nNo!

So maybe there\u2019s still an opportunity while nobody is looking that someone might try and cover up what happened instead of risking everything they\u2019ve worked so hard to keep under wraps this entire time before anything was found out about them.\nWhy would he take that chance? How long do you expect him to be able hide from the police too? They'll find him eventually especially if there is proof or connections made by others who have been questioned along with his DNA being everywhere (which means it's very possible someone will see him somewhere after this in order for something else bad not come back later down the road).\nWhy can't he just keep on going with life like normal? Nothing has happened yet anyway so why does everything need to be solved immediately instead of letting nature take its course since there is no way for anybody to know how long it would really ultimately take before someone notices anything unless by pure chance somebody remembers something from way back when.\nNothing bad needs to come from all this and what if nothing else happens besides one more person getting killed? Then everything has gone off without a hitch so why wouldn\u2019t they stay hidden under their fake identities since nobody\u2019s life has been affected in anyway outside of losing friends or family members who happened to know the right people at school (if you count yourself as someone who can relate personally since clearly nobody else will).\nWhy should he just keep on going with his life even after learning that somebody is out there trying to hurt him because they think he killed two people somewhere? If nothing had ever actually taken place after finding out, then probably no one would have ever gotten murdered because everybody wouldn't know anything was wrong until years later once everything finally caught up with them.\nI don\u2019t understand; if you want someone not found or caught by police then wouldn\u2019t going into hiding somewhere be a much better option instead of being out and about in public risking running into somebody who could identify him as well? And what difference does it ultimately make that he wasn't the one to go ahead right away anyway given how this all already came about from his brother committing such an offense?\nMaybe the person who's killing them off won't even try anymore if they know there are others involved.

If somebody is really set on killing off anyone for their wrong-doings no matter what, there isn't much anybody can do after the fact other than hope that maybe it\u2019ll all just naturally come to an end itself without anything else happening. That said though, this may prove even worse because whoever's behind all those deaths might actually be trying harder now instead of letting it go after finding out he had a brother as well; either way though they could potentially do something regardless once there has been two murders by the same person (which is how many would have occurred if everything were perfect).\nAnd how would we know this? Is there proof or evidence of any kind leading up to this point where somebody started murdering others after it became known what happened during school shootings in order for us not feel completely helpless about helping him? Because so far all I'm seeing is that he's hiding out trying his best (which may ultimately prove pointless if things were really taken further and more connections were made).\nI wish there was some way they could\u2019ve tried helping earlier on too, but nobody knew anything would happen this time until it already did. Maybe once other connections are made and people start saying something about how multiple persons ended up dying under what looks like similar circumstances, then he might want to consider going into hiding himself after all just in case which means being even harder find or found by police because there\u2019s nobody around who remembers seeing him do anything except possibly someone close enough without actually knowing why (which would probably go right along with never mentioning either one had a brother).\nBut how can you be absolutely sure they won't still try and kill everyone else after the fact if this all does really end up having another perfect outcome? I'd rather it wasn\u2019t even considered since who knows what anybody might do once again when people are thinking nothing bad happened because nobody had any clue until much later about why so many people all died except possibly somebody close enough not knowing their reasons which is still enough to get shot if something were said.\nI would suggest he stay put for awhile while the rest of this plays out, maybe there's an opportunity that'll present itself after a bit more time has passed without anything else happening besides one more murder ("",

He may feel fine now, but who knows what kind of mood somebody will be in next if their only remaining target finally comes face-to-face with them.\nIf he doesn\u2019t want his brother anywhere near this and nobody else is going to get shot on accident either as long as everybody stays out of sight then I don\u2019t see the need for more than just simply hiding until something changes or it turns out there\u2019s no way anyone can know what was really happening without being connected with those events themselves by knowing all three persons involved somehow (which means nobody would\u2019ve known otherwise until years later).

But at least we might know more about why those people died while he can just move farther away somewhere else instead of having somebody come right up and ask them in person. However that plan may not be enough if someone is really determined to murder as many people connected with school shootings they know of before anyone realizes such a thing even exists...\nI guess it all depends on how badly somebody wants their revenge whether or not they'll stop once it appears nobody else knows why those persons are dying after the fact.

I just hope that whatever happens will give somebody some kind of satisfaction given all the grief they've gone through already (including possibly being able to help stop it if need be but having no knowledge beforehand).\nI doubt we'll see too much more action unless somebody ends up saying or doing something before then which would help them either way by confirming what happened without anyone finding out their identity. There may still be an opportunity for at least one person however based on how everything was connected during school shootings (which is why I said earlier that if anybody could ever have done anything to stop things it would've been perfect if only they'd known somehow).\nBut now we'll just have to wait and see what happens; maybe there will soon be someone whose own luck runs out after failing to keep under wraps their knowledge about what happened given how impossible something like this may ultimately turn out being when all is said and done.\nWhy should he need anyone's help when nobody even knows everything's somehow connected?

1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.

2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.

She still ugly and dirty looking fuck Compton Bitch Im from Camden!!!! Home wrecking ass hoe...Laura and Gloria should have beat that ass????,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “She still ugly and dirty looking fuck Compton Bitch Im from Camden!!!! Home wrecking ass hoe...Laura and Gloria should have beat that ass????”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insulting language
2. Location references
3. Accusatory tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

I\u2019m writing this because I want to figure out why my program crashes all the time due to segmentation fault errors!\nWhen the machine crashes with SEGFAULT errors, it means that a process is attempting to access memory which is inaccessible to it, potentially overwriting code or data on the heap, stack, the global section of RAM, and so on.\nIn Linux, a kernel panic can cause a similar kind of error message, although this will also report an operating system version, computer model, and some other information about the current state of the OS machine:\nThere are several different ways to track down the specific bug that caused this. While using a debugger is the most effective method in general, there may be many reasons for this error occurring in your program.\nIt\u2019s possible that an invalid pointer or integer was passed into a variable as a result of data type mismatch in a function call or when you tried to access it after the object\u2019s scope had expired. A lack of input validation could also cause a segmentation fault, because trying to read from unallocated memory will always fail (and it might write 0\u2019s instead in some cases).\nSo if your program is crashing when you run it from one particular part of source code but not another or after running longer than usual \u2014 then chances are high that there lies an issue related to either data types, invalid pointers, improper use of malloc / free functions by programmers etc., which leads up eventually into crashing the entire application.\nI\u2019d recommend using Valgrind as it\u2019s a handy debugger for figuring out where your segfaults occur. Here is how I would debug this problem with GDB . You can find more details in the official tutorial about debugging with GDB .\nHow to Track Down Issues Caused by C /++ Bug with GCC and Eclipse\nIf you\u2019re getting SEGFAULT errors with g++, it\u2019s very likely caused by invalid pointers, memory allocation issues (e.g., malloc() or free()), integer overflows/underflows, buffer overflows, or a similar type of programming problem where part of the code is accidentally trying to access an inaccessible piece of memory.\nHere are some ways to track down the source of a segmentation fault:\n    1. Run the program in verbose mode with g++ <program> -Wall\n    2. Read through all of the error messages and look for anything suspicious like invalid pointer references; overflowed integer variables"",

    {
        ""agent"": ""Davidp456"",
        ""content"": "", undefined macro calls etc\u2026\n    3. The stack trace from this will likely show you where exactly your program crashed with seg fault.\nIf the segmentation fault occurs when attempting to access memory that is not allocated \u2013 such as via free(), a pointer reference or similar \u2013 run valgrind and use its output logs of errors caused by invalid operations. This can be used in conjunction with the above g++ options too if they don\u2019t lead you specifically to what part of code has this problem (and there may still be more than one cause).\nIn other cases, it might help to see the stack trace from a debugger like GDB . I think most compilers come with their own way but you get more functionality using a 3rd party debugger such as GDB \u2014 which will help point out where exactly in your code something went wrong.\nIt may also be sufficient simply to check on whether any memory has been allocated and released properly. If not, there\u2019s probably some sort of mismanagement going on somewhere along the way- whether it\u2019s a mistake with malloc(), freeing too much at once or failing to free parts after another function\u2019s call back into them.. In either case, using valgrind should show where exactly these issues are occurring as well.\nFinally (but don\u2019t do this without a debugger!), run your program in verbose mode by prepending its execution command with the env variable GDB. This can help reveal more detailed stack traces; I haven\u2019t used it myself but some people seem to find it helpful when all else fails.\nI would highly recommend using Valgrind if possible and available because as long as there isn\u2019t anything special about what\u2019s causing the crash \u2013 such that Valgrind cannot catch it \u2013 then any segfault should get reported by it during normal operation of your program."",

Let\u2019s find out why\u2026 The problem you are experiencing here lies within your input validation function: it does not check if there was enough information provided by the user before attempting to convert this number into an integer \u2014 which can lead to undefined behavior depending on system architecture type (64 bit vs 32).\nTo fix this , we need two things:\nA way of knowing when the user has stopped entering numbers\nSomething that"",

This way, whenever you want it to stop accepting input (for example after pressing enter), just set its value and break out of your while loop like so:\nif (!cin) // If nothing was read from cin OR there\u2019s something bad in the buffer waiting\nstd::cout << \""Invalid Input please try again:\\n\"";\nwhile (!done); // wait until done == true before continuing.\nNow all we need is a way to convert this into integers \u2013 let\u2019s use std::stringstream! It works pretty much how it sounds: you give it some kind of string input (in your case, what the user types), then ask it for either an int or float output depending on what information you provided. Here\u2019s how my main function ended up looking after adding in both of these features:\n    std::cin >> number; // Get next number entered by user\n        if (!number)\n                std::cout << \""Invalid Number please try again: \"";\nIn short, adding some basic validation checks has allowed us to avoid any potential issues due to invalid input and ensures that only valid values are passed into our square calculation logic.\nI hope this helps!

A program typically crashes when it encounters an invalid memory read/write, which can be caused by accessing an invalid data address or dereferencing a null pointer within your codebase.\nThe issue you\u2019re facing likely stems from this line:\nint *x_ptr = new (int)[4];\nOn line 1, x_ptr will point to the first element allocated on the heap. On line 10, it tries to access memory that has been deallocated when i == 4 . Your program crashes at runtime because you\u2019re trying to read/write from a part of memory no longer accessible.\nThere are a few ways around this.\nYou can keep track of your allocation/deallocation in one spot by using std::vector. It handles all of the housekeeping for you so there aren\u2019t any dangling references after calling clear().\nclass YourClass {\n  std::vector<int> myInts;\n  void allocate(int size){\n    if (size <= 0) \n      throw std::length_error(\""Invalid Allocation Size\""); \n    myInts.resize(size);\n  void deallocate() {\n  int getAt(size_t index) const { \nThe allocation is explicit \u2013 just call allocate() with the desired capacity.

In this case, line 10 attempts to access memory beyond allocated boundaries because the vector was resized on line 5 while loop iteration is happening.\nThe fix requires changing how things are done so there aren\u2019t any dangling references after calling clear(). One solution could involve using a different data structure like std::list (which doesn\u2019t resize unexpectedly during iterations) or writing code manually without using any libraries \u2013 both choices require rewriting your logic from scratch though!\nFor help with other questions about C++ programming , ask on Reddit for specific answers to what you\u2019re struggling with. Thanks so much! \ud83d\ude42\nHey there, pal! So I was working away at this problem-solving puzzle game but suddenly my program just crapped out and gave me a SEGFAULT error message like an old arcade machine from the 90s.\nI tried debugging it in Visual Studio but no dice \u2013 every time I step through my code with gdb it just quits when executing that if statement on line ten!\nCan you help me figure out how to fix this?

        ""content"": ""\u2019s like they have minds of their own sometimes..\nHi there. I\u2019ve seen this same kind of problem before while working on projects in C++ using g++. Usually the issue lies within something being accessed by a process which isn\u2019t accessible to it.\nThis can happen due to attempting to access memory that has had its scope narrowed down, or trying to change values within static functions that are only applicable to one instance but you\u2019re treating them like they belonged inside of another class instance instead.\nIt could even be because there were too many pointers being created leading up into this function being invoked which then caused things not to initialize properly leading up until crashing at runtime \u2013 but more often than not (like yours), some kind invalid pointer is the culprit here.\nIn order to debug these kinds of errors properly, you\u2019ll need access to both gcc debugger as well as Valgrind in addition to a compiler for C++ source code. Without all three pieces in place together it\u2019s extremely difficult if even possible at all times because there are so many different ways these kinds problems could arise.\nIf I had experience with debugging C++, then I bet that my process would look something like this:\nStep 1: Using the debugger, single step through your application until you get to a segmentation fault (or any other error). This will help pinpoint where in source code it happens and what conditions triggered it. If there are no errors after running then repeat from Step 2.\nStep 2: Check the call stack at each level of execution prior leading up to crash point; this may involve looking over data passed by reference/pointer etc., making sure they have correct values throughout all parts involved including inside function calls & parameters too \u2013 sometimes even variables within loops can cause issues so check those carefully!\nThis is what I would do personally if given just that much information on an error like yours without knowing anything else about how my own code works. But hey, everyone has their own way and whatever method works for me won\u2019t necessarily work best for someone else!"",

Problem is that no matter how many times I try running the source code, every time my console outputs out an error regarding segmentation fault.\nIn short, when a process tries to access memory that isn\u2019t part of its own address space (or perhaps an attempt at reading from/write to already-deallocated memory); if it encounters this type thing then yeah\u2026the machine is definitely going to crash. This can also happen due to some sorta misused pointers (i.e. passing around pointers without ensuring they still point to valid locations).\nThe error usually starts off like so:\nThat being said, the best tool to use for tracking down exactly which part of source code triggers off a SEGFAULT alert is a debugger \u2013 such as gdb.\nI\u2019d also look out for any suspicious pointer operations, particularly those close together with an explicit cast involved; and check that they don\u2019t exceed their size in any way. This can sometimes get difficult because it\u2019s hard to tell how big something is unless someone has measured ahead of time (and if there was ever something wrong before then\u2026well).\nWhen looking over logs for issues related to SEGFAULTs, always start from the top and work downward until you are able to find out exactly what caused this warning \u2013 sometimes one issue may lead into another later down line without being apparent immediately after each occurrence though! For instance:\n\u2013 First off there was an error message about a missing \u2018const\u2019 on some variable; this caused issues when calling certain functions since they expected different input values than were actually supplied (incorrect output followed shortly following). Then because it didn\u2019t match up properly between inputs/outputs, another function failed which then led even further downstream until everything came crashing down like dominoes!\n\u2013 Another time somebody thought that they could save some space by making certain integer variables constant throughout their application rather than just for the duration within each module (but this ended being more trouble than it was worth). It took multiple iterations for them to realize how problematic these kinds errors have been getting because instead of catching one small problem at a time\u2026 Now everything cascades down until everything crashes! Yikes!\n\u2013 I recall another occasion where someone tried making use of pointers even though they knew that the values changed quite often\u2026but also wasn\u2019t too sure whether or not other people who were working on this would notice either, so decided to leave something behind for them"",

It sometimes takes a lot of patience and experience before you are able to pick apart each one, so don\u2019t feel discouraged if it seems like nothing is making sense right now!\nThat being said, here\u2019s some quick tips for helping out with this whole ordeal:\n  1. Read through all of your logs (especially those generated by Valgrind). If any parts seem unclear then ask questions until someone can provide additional help in understanding them.\n  2. Run the application under gdb; use \u201cbt\u201d command if it crashes to get full stack trace which will show you exactly where problem has occurred along with all related functions / variables etc so that way everyone involved knows exactly what went wrong (or right)!\nI hope these tips were helpful to you in your quest of fixing those pesky little bugs within your apps. Good luck, and stay strong!\nSo I was working on this code project using C++ and GCC as the compiler tools, but it just won\u2019t compile no matter how many times I try running the source file.\nI can tell that there\u2019s something wrong because I get a warning error message that goes like:\nThat being said, while these kinds of messages are super helpful in detecting potential bugs and mistakes within codebase, they don\u2019t exactly provide any specific clues as to where inside your current application this problem is stemming from. That\u2019s why it would be incredibly useful if you were able to get access into debugger like gdb \u2013 such a tool allows one to single step through their program until crashing point (aka SIGSEGV) and then inspect all variables + functions which have been called upon leading up till failure.\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t know what exactly could potentially be causing this issue since it appears that both GCC version 11.2-1r and C++11 support are being used for this project! Is there any chance somebody out there can point me in the right direction?\nSorry to hear about your problem with getting code compiled under gcc 11.2-1r ! I think one of possible solutions would be reverting back down to an earlier stable release until you figure out exactly what is causing this issue (hopefully not a bug).\nAnother option that may work better might involve installing different versions side-by-side; just choose one as default for each project and make sure it does indeed produce expected results every time before moving onto next step"",

This way you don\u2019t have to worry about accidentally messing things up when switching back-and-fourth between them without even knowing it!\nIf all else fails though I suppose there\u2019s always the option of using another IDE platform which doesn\u2019t appear to suffer from this same sort problem (such as MSVC).\nI know that for me personally, I\u2019ve heard quite good things about Microsoft Visual Studio and its built-in debugger \u2013 perhaps you\u2019ll find more joy in working with such a product? Anyway, whatever solution(s) work best for you will depend largely upon individual context so if none of these suggestions turn fruitful don\u2019t hesitate to try something else that might do the job instead! \ud83d\ude42\nI hope my advice was helpful to you in your troubleshooting journey \u2013 good luck and happy coding!\nSo I\u2019ve been trying out a certain C++ programming project using the GCC compiler tool, and it just won\u2019t run!\nWhenever I attempt to start running this thing though all that happens is for my console terminal output to spit out an error message which looks exactly like so:\nThat being said, in order to really pin down why things aren\u2019t working properly you\u2019d likely want access into a debugger such as gdb since this tool can provide very helpful information when attempting to catch bugs within any system during runtime.\nWithout this kind of insight it would be extremely difficult if not even downright impossible at times for one person working alone (especially when dealing with larger codebases where there exists more complex relationships between files + modules).\nIf you were to have access into such a tool though there\u2019s still a good chance that things might end up being quite challenging since modern IDEs often come preinstalled with advanced tools & utilities such as static analyzers which can help catch bugs before they ever even reach runtime \u2013 these kinds products certainly aren\u2019t too friendly towards those who are new to their respective niches!\nThat being said, without having access into any sort of debugging platform (like maybe an IDE or something ) then all one might be able to do with this situation is hope that the issue lies in some more basic form like wrong syntax/typo. However if this happens to not pan out you could try running Valgrind instead which has been proven over time as being exceptionally useful for identifying bugs even across various levels of code (C++ included!) so definitely something worth considering at least.\nHopefully these tips were able to provide some sort help in solving your problem \u2013 good luck!"",

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Sleep criticism
3. Shower recommendation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

For the most part anyway.\nThe beginning of March was not as glorious.\nI mean this in both senses.\nMarch 9th I felt like a huge ass of something or another. You see, I had a friend reach out for help with her own eating habits. And I tried.\nIt did not go so great and I did something terrible.\nThis is the part where you should turn away if you're not into reading about suicide and depression triggers from eating disorders. Or if you want to take a break. Go get some water or feed your dog some food. Give yourself a hug... You know, something kind.\nI had been doing so well with all these plans I was following that I just wanted to see more results as fast as possible. Because it was such a big deal for me and my health, and self-confidence depended on it, I started skipping meals. Even the small ones. And I felt really sick.\nAnd one afternoon I tried reaching out to a friend. In person. But she was in class so I just wanted to vent and go home. Alone. So after class we met up at this little local bakery/caf\u00e9 where we were gonna have some coffee and a chat. She had a bagel with cream cheese and I was about to order my usual.\nI thought... Why not grab some fries? I can eat something too, right?\nIt wasn't even 6.30 am for crying out loud and all I wanted were potato sticks! As we walked into the store, this idea started eating me up inside. And I began to panic because in my mind everything was going wrong . I had been good since... I don\u2019t know how long.\nI mean, a couple of weeks! Maybe even more! My plan wasn\u2019t working. Not if I couldn\u2019t make myself eat something as small as that. How would I ever be able to work out?\nThis girl ordered her stuff and then looked at me:\n\""SarahLyn, what did you want to have?\""\nI had already worked up the perfect answer:\n\""I'll get this later!\"" And made a dash for home.\nOh but wait! You know it goes without saying that there's always something that happens right after.\nI got back home from my friend and I'm sure you can guess what was about to happen. At least if you've experienced these things before .\nBecause nothing happens without a reason, I"",

This week : I haven\u2019t been eating normally because I'm on this plan to lose weight\nI thought if skipping meals a few times could actually help with losing 5kg in just a couple of weeks, it HAD to work! Or something like this.\nI felt really good when I left the bakery and was looking forward to having my lunch. But not so much later that day when I got really hungry AND sick at the same fucking time . The first thing that crossed my mind as dinner approached:\n\""What if I just never told you?\""\nAnd let me tell you, it took a lot for me TO EVEN write out all of this. It was hard to think about these events which actually happened 2 years ago.\nI've thought about writing about what happened for ages now but couldn't even fathom doing it. This is also why I didn\u2019t want to get into much detail either. And that's pretty okay because my main motivation for this post was to reflect on the past. To see where things went wrong and what changes I made since then.\nIf you're looking forward to finding out about one of these changes, let me tell you there are 3 I wanna talk about. They'll hopefully help you find something good in whatever you have been dealing with. Maybe you're in a situation that seems so shitty right now. But it doesn't matter how long ago or recent the bad things happen as long as they haven\u2019t changed who you really can and should be.\n1st: I've made peace with my past (self-loathing included). And it's such an enormous milestone in life to reach! It might seem like a tiny step but it's worth all effort when you're finally able to start focusing on your future instead of being stuck in the shit-hole for way too long.\nBut if you don\u2019t know how, here\u2019s what helped me with this one:\nWrite everything out . I would go down memory lane whenever bad feelings came upon me and list what has happened. It was hard but it really took away some of that power these thoughts had over me. Because once I felt a bit less anxious or stressed after writing all the shit I experienced, I saw things much clearer. Especially in hindsight.

It's almost like I take on a whole new perspective.\n3rd: I've made it through before and I know I can do it again . The best part about having been there is feeling empowered by that! You see, this was something else which made my list for quite some time but it wasn't until after getting back into eating normally without skipping meals or anything related to unhealthy thoughts on food whatsoever. So yeah... It's pretty awesome when you look ahead and feel like anything is possible even if it seems close to impossible right now.\nIf I had a dollar for all the days where I thought about never telling anyone but actually did, you guys would have a lot of money because sometimes it sucks having everything come out at once in one day. Especially if there's no way for anyone involved to recover from what got said without any help either . But anyway, I was pretty afraid someone might notice something wrong with me when we ate lunch that same week.\nIf they were too busy, however, it would be much easier:\n\""I don't know what you're talking about. Of course I had fries already!\""\nEven though the fact remained that all of this went down at this one meeting place in town.\nAnd then there was this friend who reached out to me asking if it's okay if she goes somewhere private so we are alone...\n\""Oh my god! Why? What did you do now?\""\nBut no worries, I wasn't a teenager anymore and didn't have a problem going outside of things I said on the spot. So that evening we sat down at this table which just happened to be far away from everybody else eating lunch so there would really ONLY be us alone.\n\""SarahLyn... What's wrong?\"" She asked as she was about to order something for dinner too .\n\""I need help. And you can't share what I'm gonna tell with anyone.\""\nAnd that same night we talked .

The next thing I knew however - it felt like hours had passed when really just one more person left for work so now there was less light outside; which also happened happen by itself though I guess because we aren't always aware if someone else is watching us all the time.\nThe only reason I can think of when people might not want to tell friends about these things is if they feel too ashamed or embarrassed since nobody should act like that towards themselves just because others may disapprove; which unfortunately still happens today even after so much progress has been made over time with regards mental illness and healthy eating habits alike.\nIt was getting late so we ended up finishing most of our conversation by chat before deciding to meet another day when both had more time together. My friend asked whether there were problems other than what came out in the beginning and I simply didn't know how much they would be able or willing help with so instead just said no; making myself feel better since sometimes it's easier to focus on one thing at first before adding anything else later.\nAs she was walking back home, however...

Nigga u ain't got no job man,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Nigga u ain't got no job man”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Verbal aggression
2. Lack of employment
3. Racial slur","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

There are many reasons why you might be interested in using an open source operating system, and one of the most compelling is that it costs nothing.\nLinux distros tend to offer a robust base OS with no strings attached while Windows forces you into purchasing software bundles which may cost even after they expire. If your PC can\u2019t handle modern video games then Linux will likely run faster on it for all but the newest MMOs and indie titles anyway. (more\u2026)\nThe problem is one of scale. It\u2019s not that we can\u2019t produce enough food to feed the world \u2013 it\u2019s that a lot of people don\u2019t want their society structured around producing enough food to survive.

Money is the measure of success because everyone knows, and it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone tells them \u2013 people are selfish.\nFor most people, if they have enough food today and can get paid later instead of now they will do things that put them in a position where they don\u2019t know exactly when their next meal is coming. Even worse than that they\u2019ll go shopping or eating out before the money comes in. There\u2019s always going to be something you want just out your reach, because this stuff goes deep in all of us.\nAnd even if they are able to get by living for tomorrow, there still aren\u2019t many people willing to do anything but exactly what their comfortable with doing right now .

The problem is going to be incremental because humans are greedy.\nFor example: Let\u2019s say tomorrow the government gets rid of all minimum wage laws and then everyone makes whatever they can ask for .

This isn\u2019t as easy as most people think either. You will need equipment which means money, but don\u2019t let that scare you too much since there are ways around this. Most prosumer cameras these days are cheap and very good at producing decent quality footage, especially when combined with lighting and sound gear.\nSo now that we have a plot and some decent camcorders at our disposal let\u2019s get to actually shooting the damn thing. First off, I\u2019m just going to assume you aren\u2019t using some sort of dlc video editor like iMovie or Windows MovieMaker for this since they really don\u2019t offer anything in the way of professional capability if that matters to you.\nInstead choose something that is more feature rich and offers a lot more functionality but don\u2019t go too far with it either. Something intermediate is usually best so programs such as Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere or Sony Vegas are good options depending on your operating system (they also offer free versions).\nOnce this software has been installed you\u2019ll likely want to create some storyboards (in order to keep the film focused) but there\u2019s no need for expensive paper since there are lots of free templates online. You could also just use a simple Word document with bullet points and diagrams if that sounds easier to work out without too much overhead.\nYou might think getting all this gear, shooting your little masterpiece and editing into something watchable would take hours upon weeks until at last a project is complete enough for viewing.\nWell, it can certainly go on and be even more tedious yet depending on how big the movie is. But even with just a few actors and basic sets it could easily take weeks to film (more than likely months) which means you have so much time invested into creating this thing it would make sense that at the very least there\u2019s always room for improvement when making another version after seeing how well the first one turned out.\nAnd then there are these fancy post production processes called color grading, sound design etc.. which not only need professional software but also training to use properly too. So yeah sure you might get lucky and make something halfway decent right off without doing any of this stuff (some even do for their early productions) otherwise though it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that most of these types will have an ugly look by today\u2019s standards since they lack basic editing or have all kinds of technical issues.\nSo with movies being such an intimidating genre you"",

Instead consider reading How To Be Free of Debt by Dave Ramsey which covers everything in detail.\nThis article is going to cover some strategies on how you can maximize your income while minimizing expenses so that more money goes into saving then paying off debt and bills since this is the only way to be financially free . The key ideas here are:\nStop consuming things that don\u2019t provide any utility, or if they do provide some form of value make sure it\u2019s enough to justify the cost.\nThink long-term about your goals. This means not spending more than you can afford so you\u2019re going into savings every month instead of living paycheck to paycheck where if something happens there is no safety net .\nAlways have a buffer fund in case unexpected expenses come up. If someone breaks their finger at work you don\u2019t want them being laid off because they didn\u2019t take the time off.\nInvest wisely in stocks, real estate etc.. so when money does get thrown out it gets put back into something that will help grow your net worth over time vs throwing away for entertainment purposes then having nothing left after everything is said and done like spending lots of money every weekend on going to different parties all the damn time which never ends up helping anyone but just leaves people dead broke with no way out since there\u2019s nothing left once bills come due again the next month."",

The important thing here is realizing where things need improvement so they don\u2019t have any negative impact on what you\u2019re trying accomplish because in order for someone like me who has never been rich but managed their finances reasonably well they didn\u2019t get there just through luck it was due to their own hard work in both finding good investment opportunities over the years as well planning properly from early on how much money should be set aside so I had a nice buffer for unexpected expenses while staying out of debt which allowed me to focus more effort onto increasing income because even though working harder wasn\u2019t always enjoyable but knowing how close I was coming made it worth everything .\nNever forget this.

What matters most isn\u2019t coming up with any master plan some perfect formulaic step-by-step process instead just doing whatever works best for each individual so their progress can continue getting better & faster as they go along. For example, if someone already has really bad debt right now then working towards becoming financially free will require them focusing solely on paying down that high interest rate debt first before moving onto anything else since otherwise they\u2019ll never ever be able to get ahead .\nA lot of people are scared off by retirement because it requires so much effort and time (even more so than when they were young!), which leads most either to delay things further or not doing any planning until well past the time which makes reaching their goals nearly impossible then eventually giving up entirely since there\u2019s really no point anymore.\nThe truth is you don\u2019t have to be great at saving money from a young age right away, all that matters is finding good strategies for becoming financially free and sticking with them over time . So find something simple like investing in index funds if someone doesn\u2019t know much about stocks yet but wants to get started investing soon enough they can learn along the way without needing too much advanced knowledge beforehand (or even having any at all!).\nThe key is not trying to do everything yourself right from day 1 which only leads most people giving up before getting their full potential reached since there\u2019s never anything wrong with seeking help outside sources like finding a qualified financial advisor to assist in creating an optimal plan unique specifically for your needs (which would be much more difficult and time-consuming if done solo). Just make sure they don\u2019t require high fees otherwise there\u2019s likely no way this will work long term either due all those additional costs required making it not worth doing any longer than necessary.\nFor example, if someone has really bad debt right now then getting them financially free isn\u2019t going to happen magically without taking steps towards paying down that interest-rate laden credit card/loan etc. first otherwise progress will be slow & frustrating since every month money won\u2019t do much of anything except cover those loans instead being put into a real long-term investment.\nAnd don\u2019t forget there\u2019s nothing wrong with spending some money either on enjoyment too, just make sure it doesn\u2019t take up most of your funds otherwise you\u2019ll never have enough left over for reaching financial freedom.

Some people find they\u2019re able to pay down more than 3x their income while others only get that level much faster so while they were already ahead in the game even though things didn\u2019t work out perfectly well right away there was still some forward movement .\nThat example from above about paying off debt could lead someone starting with 100% of every dollar spent going towards paying off their debts but then discovering later on in life it wasn\u2019t working anymore after struggling for months or years so they stopped which doesn\u2019t mean anything because during all those periods when things aren\u2019t running smoothly there were still advances being made along the way which shows why even if someone has a \u201cbad month\u201d they shouldn\u2019t give up since just one success later is enough to get back on track again!\nAnd what about those people who never seem to make much progress at all ? They are the ones that have no choice but to continue trying whatever strategy until it works (or doesn\u2019t), and even if nothing seems to stick for months or years they will still find a way eventually since everyone has different levels of natural ability to do these things with varying degrees of luck along the way too which means no one is invincible from all potential roadblocks!\nMost people fall into this category because it\u2019s much easier than most of us realize until we try doing something ourselves and see how long it takes before our desired outcome actually happens (if ever!). For example: Someone might be so good at saving money but then not have nearly as high an aptitude in investing which means even though they\u2019re ahead overall from being frugal while also earning enough income to stay afloat during tough times there could easily come periods where things take longer than expected due various reasons out of their control (such as market volatility).\nThe important thing"",

This is because it\u2019s much easier for most of us to make incremental improvements in one area without feeling overwhelmed while also enjoying life along the way instead trying so hard to try out everything under all pressure situations which means there\u2019s rarely any joy being experienced (and sometimes none at ALL !).\nSo even though reaching financial freedom is difficult and time-consuming it doesn\u2019t mean anyone should give up before doing their best since almost nobody becomes rich instantly!

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Humor
2. Amusement
3. Agreement","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

All you have to remember is this:\nShe doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re not friends.\nIf anyone ever questions where her son went he can always say it was to find friends since kids tend to do that sort of thing.\nWe will get back some money tomorrow after work no matter when things happen by asking around while we have the time. The longer everyone stays away though, the less likely they won\u2019t notice so I would go sooner rather than later with everything if you don\u2019t mind.\nHm\u2026 that seems reasonable enough so long as it works out for me as well since she might not be interested in anything else once things start going better but before then?\nThat\u2019s right; her mother will probably still have questions until she makes some money of course. But once she has enough, I bet it\u2019ll all die down quickly which is why you don\u2019t really want to bother bringing anything up during the night.\nAnd there would be a chance with us being away anyway since no one knows where we are after dark so there wouldn\u2019t really be any reason for them not letting things stay quiet unless they do come back early in the morning before work. If that happens though then we\u2019d just go straight to making money ourselves and dealing with whatever questions she might have at lunchtime later on.\nThat sounds alright! I\u2019ll take care of her part while you both get him ready okay?\nHahaha, all right then! Come over here first so I can give them this\u2026\nOh no wait..! It\u2019s not working\u2026!\nI think he got spooked by something or someone. If we rush it might draw some unwanted attention though so how about we try again when no one is looking? Is that better?\nYes! But I don\u2019t know what it could have been since everything was pretty quiet just now huh\u2026\nHere you go, here\u2019s some money.\nWhat kind of joke is this!? Here!!

I hope everything goes well and there aren\u2019t any more run ins with your mother until you find a way back home or something right?\nYeah, definitely! Well I think its about time we both headed off so here\u2019s wishing us good luck with everything too. We\u2019ll see each other tomorrow morning first thing though okay? Just try not to worry yourself too much about it all tonight.\nHey hey now don\u2019t get too cocky yet. You still have a long way to go before either of them will be completely healed up or anything so just take your time and make sure you aren\u2019t rushing things because they hurt for longer than normal. They probably won\u2019t last very far into tomorrow if that\u2019s what your plan was.\nIt isn\u2019t like we can\u2019t help him though right? I know it\u2019d only slow us down a bit but the more time we give them to recover means the greater chance of them actually being fine without getting sick or anything afterwards as well since they\u2019ll both be able to take care of themselves better too by that point.\nOh come on now don\u2019t get so greedy about everything all at once. Not every bad thing happens in one shot and you have just gotten started with this sort of stuff anyway so who knows what might happen down the line if you do keep going like it?\nAlright then, I\u2019ll take my time but be careful to get as far away from here as possible before that so someone doesn\u2019t notice him being gone tomorrow morning when they wake up.\nRight okay and make sure we meet each other no later than right after she leaves for work though because if something has a chance of going off well then its best not wait until it all sorts itself out after lunchtime like yesterday was already close to becoming. Don\u2019t forget about her friend either since he still looks really bad too.\nYeah yeah I remember! See ya tomorrow then I guess but don\u2019t worry you won\u2019t have any issues with your backside at the very least at least since it\u2019s not going to stay sore forever so that\u2019s a relief even if everything else hurts pretty good right now though huh?"",

Oh well such is what happens though when people choose not to think before they act you know.\nWell yeah, I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be wise if someone did do something like that right on the spot now would it especially during a time frame where there will be lots of people around too. Maybe one person might pass by without even noticing anything but then multiple witnesses always end up being worse than just one or two in these sorts of situations which is why its best to avoid them as much as possible when you can instead huh? Even someone hearing something could start telling rumors on top of everything else and that never helps anyone\u2019s cause either.\nAh what am I doing still wasting my time talking about this for goodness sake though!? We\u2019ve done nothing but walk around all night long now so its time to move along already. Good luck (again) today again okay just don\u2019t get any more injuries than the two you\u2019re carrying right now at least if you can help it please.\nOh wow I thought that would take a lot longer! They didn\u2019t look half bad really though considering everything they\u2019d gone through but still got them healed up good so now no one should notice anything being wrong other than the normal soreness everyone gets from getting pummeled like they just had been. Plus even then it wouldn\u2019t be all that noticeable since its mostly in their backs which is why I knew this part would go pretty quickly for everything except maybe the bruising so long as they took their time with that anyway.\nPhew what a relief!

Haha! At least we don\u2019t have to do anything but pretend nothing bad happened during all of this then so there\u2019s still hope that someone might not notice something being off with him especially when its dark out since anyone paying attention would spot at least the shadows changing depending on where it is along his face and head which isn\u2019t good for keeping things discreet other than trying to walk faster like we both already know without drawing too much attention or running into anyone who wants a fight but at least that seems pretty unlikely now considering how late its getting anyway right?\nAll right!

U needa delete ths shit,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “U needa delete ths shit”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Delete request
3. Profanity","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

platform: Facebook messenger

victim: InfantAngel

victim persona: InfantAngel is a 30-year-old mother of two newborn twins. She enjoys sharing her experience raising infants with other parents and recommends various baby products that she found helpful.

harasser: NightmareNanny

harasser persona: NightmareNanny is a 35-year-old stay-at-home mom who frequently vented frustration about being at home with her three toddlers online. She resents InfantAngel's seemingly easy life as she believes her twins are too demanding.

2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

This website is for infants and is, therefore, full of stupid people who love babies as well as baby stuff.\nIf you are in need of help, then maybe try www.askjeeves.com.\nIn all honesty though, you did have a good idea by trying to help me with my questions. Infants can't type or do that other stuff that humans can do and they can often lack knowledge on certain topics unless they are educated into it by their parents (i.e when they explain things for the infant's benefit when they encounter something unfamiliar).\nBut, alas, your good intentions have been wasted. There is nothing you can do to help me now so I'll just lie here in my crib.\nWhy won't somebody please think of the babies?!\nI will go google that and then come back an post what it says under the question because I cannot read a website with all those words on it.\n@InfantAngel.

Please go back and re-read the question - does that link really answer the entire question?\nYou'll also notice my signature on this site says \""Have questions? Post them here!\"" I did exactly that and I'm still here so there must not be anything wrong with it. It's just you don't want to hear some of these things because they make you uncomfortable.\nI am a baby expert, which obviously means that I know exactly what babies look like.\nIt's pretty hard for an adult person (especially someone who is not in their infant years) to tell whether someone else is indeed a baby. They have their own ways to make sure the answerer is in fact a newborn and they will usually give hints of what is necessary of themselves in order to answer, such as age or experience.\nI am going to go into a very deep sleep now because my mother says that babies should do things like this frequently. Don't forget: I AM A BABY EXPERT!\n@InfantAngel.

If I don't go back into my crib soon enough then she may get annoyed at me which would be really bad since she probably won't want me anymore - a scary prospect for any infant like myself!\nThis site is not designed to be answered by another person as you think it does. This site was made so that people of the same group ask questions in order to gain and share knowledge about the topic.\nYou are not a baby expert, if you were then you would have probably seen a lot of babies and had experience from being one.\nBeing an infant (a baby) is different depending on your age. A 5 day old is considered to be an infant whereas an 6 month year old is not regarded as this due to the fact they are able to move more independently. Therefore questions asked could differ in what response infants should give.\nIt is very unlikely that someone would see a baby's post and get angry unless it was meant for them. It depends on their type of emotion - if they have high empathy, they will understand your emotions and you may not even know that they had been angered by the post but for most people anger occurs from feeling threatened in some way.\nBabies are not experts at all things just as anyone who lives on Earth is an expert when it comes living on another planet or being able to talk with aliens so don't get too over confident about your knowledge of babies, you never know what an alien baby could teach humans like us!\n@InfantAngel. My question (which is the actual post itself) was posted as a way for others in this group to share and gain knowledge on topics that deal with Infants/Babies, not so a person can answer my questions.\nIf I need someone to answer me then that would most likely be my mother who would know all about being a infant/baby since she raised or has been there with me at the time of being one.\nA baby experts job is to take care of another child and do whatever it takes too.

Ok really Lexi .. You don't fucking know her so stop acting like she's your best freakin friend ! Leave my best friends alone . Jeez ! @lexi_volleyball_2,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Ok really Lexi .. You don't fucking know her so stop acting like she's your best freakin friend ! Leave my best friends alone . Jeez ! @lexi_volleyball_2”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Lexi
2. Best friend
3. Anger","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

You can still do some fun stuff with books without reading at all.\nThere are a lot ways to explore books without even opening one up! Whether it\u2019s finding the coolest book covers in your house or putting them back into their proper places after cleaning, there is so much more going on under the surface that could be explored if only people focused less on reading them.

In fact, I\u2019d say most of us probably waste time trying to read something instead of doing anything else\u2026 But no worries; that means even more opportunities are available when you know how much potential there really is out there in the world around us.\u201d\nThis article will discuss some of our favorite book-related activities and show you how you can enjoy books without ever having to read a single word.\nThe best book covers\nBooks are often judged by their cover, but what if you want to judge them based on something else? Why not get your hands dirty finding the coolest old book covers in town?\nIf this sounds like your kind of thing then make sure to scroll through these awesome examples and find which ones interest you.\nThe best book covers are the ones with great graphics:\nThere has always been a debate over what makes good cover art; whether it\u2019s something that appeals to visual aesthetics or just plain usefulness- after all, if nobody wants to look at your book then how else will they know about it! Regardless of why certain covers get more love than others there is no denying some seem better than others\u2026 Which raises another question- what makes good artwork anyway? And does anyone actually care anymore as long as their favourite novel gets onto the bestseller list?\nAnd here are just a few suggestions:\n1.

Many book lovers will have compiled lists of their favorite reads which others can peruse when they need some new reading material. Some people create reviews on these online platforms whereas others simply provide links to buy them directly from Amazon or another retail outlet.\nThe internet is a great place to find information about any subject you\u2019re interested in, including books. You may be looking for something specific but don\u2019t want to start digging into all of those dusty old shelves that are in your local library! If this sounds like what\u2019s happening then why not use GoodReads? The site hosts thousands upon thousands (if not millions) of user-generated lists based on genres ranging from adventure fantasy stories right up-to-date news items published yesterday.\nWhy look at alternative sources? It might be the only way you can get a sense of what others are reading these days if all your friends have already read every popular title out there and they don\u2019t want anything but romance novels now.

2. Hair color","1. Mortality and Death
2. Religious beliefs and god's existence
3. Arrogance of humans","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

In such a conversation, it would be expected that one person does not control most of the discourse and tell their opinions as if they are fact while anyone who disagrees are told to shut up since they lack intelligence.\nTo give you an example, let's say several people got together in some place with alcohol or drugs and someone claims that we are all here because aliens from outer space abducted our ancestors. The rest of the group would rightfully try to convince him otherwise without attacking his character simply for offering something different than what others believe in.\nIt is clear that if one insists on their opinion as being fact, then no discussion can occur since facts do not need to be \""discussed.\""\nIt's like asking, \""Do rocks fall toward earth because gravity exists or they simply fall on the earth at an unseen force which always causes them to fall?\"" It would all depend on whether we accept that gravity is one of many other forces in the Universe.\nWhen it comes to philosophy, each person brings their own experiences and observations into the mix. Based on these, a different system can be developed than what others have. This could be good or bad depending on just how much evidence there actually is for its beliefs and the level of logical consistency within it when trying to make new ideas logically flow from the old ones.\nFor example, some people develop a philosophy that states only actions which produce pleasure are considered morally correct because happiness should always be pursued as the primary goal while everything else has no other value as good or bad in itself. It's interesting to see how this can still end up with very different moral standards than utilitarianism since there is much disagreement over what actually causes pleasure, if any kind of pleasure needs to last for it to count and just who is entitled to enjoy that pleasure.\nSince each person has their own way looking at reality, so will they have their own system which makes sense according to them. This means that every philosophy is going to be correct but only within the scope of its basic axioms and assumptions before any logic has been done or applied.\nI agree with you, and I believe a discussion should be an exchange of ideas not insults or mockery, even if we don't agree on some things we shouldn't take it personal."",

        ""content"": "" It would appear that there is another issue which could be the source of such rudeness: jealousy. It's possible some people have difficulty talking about existential philosophy in general and do not wish others to read any new information about it. This is especially likely if they are the only ones doing so, since everyone else believes what a celebrity says, for example.\nThis would explain why there is an ongoing campaign by so many media outlets to promote atheism as the alternative to Christianity but without offering any other religious alternatives at all that might be true, or at least have merit on equal grounds with each other. It might also help provide another reason why the scientific establishment seeks to control so much education and information as well while they continue trying their best to eliminate all competition from any field of thought.\nThey may not even realize what it is they fear since they would believe these others are simply being too foolish in their beliefs (e.g. science) instead of a real source of competition or threat. Such an unconscious bias may explain why so many people react with ridicule towards existentialists and other metaphysicians, often calling us names like 'theists' even if we don't hold views on metaphysical issues much different from one another beyond what is already assumed by the mainstream.\nIt's also important to note that such ridicule can be quite common in groups of atheists as an attempt at self-preservation within those very same groups! Atheist apologist often seem terrified by anything about religion. Their beliefs might not hold up and they may know it better than others who don't realize this, which could help explain the irrational reactions to existential philosophy and other religious alternatives being presented, even if there isn't a conscious intention involved; I believe jealousy and fear of competition is most likely at their source instead\nThis kind of reaction can actually be an indication that certain ideas are hitting close to home for those who react in such a manner. The problem comes when they make up lies about existentialists by attributing things we never said or mean simply because it helps support false claims being made as if they were fact, as well!\nI find myself wanting more people understand what it is I am trying share about, since all my time spent working on philosophy has not been without its rewards. The problem with the state of this field at present is that there are too many different approaches by philosophers to be able to make sense out of them without going into some area where they overlap or agree.\nTherefore, it would greatly help others if only more authors could put down their biases for a moment and"",

This is especially true when coming from existentialism, which has its own unique form of philosophy very different than most philosophers since this involves personal experience rather than something that can be seen by others.\nIt's unfortunate this cannot happen more often but I am hopeful some day there will come about an approach able to combine all the various methods currently utilized while adding new ones not yet discovered. I think if enough people get involved and help promote such thinking, then it might eventually occur!\nPerhaps philosophers from all around can be persuaded by me since most share my values even though they might disagree on individual points regarding some issues. There certainly has been much progress made recently and more is possible now too with technology being used to improve communication while also allowing people who live far away as well those within our own communities get together, sharing ideas easily among others.\nPerhaps we can work towards making philosophy a topic of public discussion in such a way that encourages participation by anyone interested no matter where they happen to reside instead of trying to force everyone else into the same mold. There are many approaches out there already, though only if one considers each type as their own subject rather than part of something else.\nI would say most do not consider philosophy from this perspective but it is important for people to realize the field can be broken down into different areas according to what it deals with since all things aren't related to one another at the level they currently are. The problem comes when too many people only recognize one approach and then try treating everything else as if they were all trying saying exactly same thing, which I think is unfair.\nThere may never come about an agreement regarding most issues faced by human beings however; even when we do reach accord it often changes before long due different new factors arising from time period. This doesn't seem a good reason for everyone to go around arguing against one another though because each view might be right in its own way regardless if they are opposed or not, which might explain why such situations occur and how this leads people towards different paths in order to find out more about themselves and world through life experience alone."",

This will allow us all to gain insight into how different perspectives can co-exist while still remaining unique in what they offer, rather than simply focusing narrowly on commonalities between views which could help others find the best option available.\nIn my view there are two problems: Firstly people fail to make the proper distinction between philosophy and religion. They do not see that existentialism is essentially a system of thinking and has nothing specifically religious about it except for the metaphysical aspect, that's often missing from other forms of materialistic atheism anyway!\nSecondly, those atheists who think it should be considered as a form of rational belief don't actually care enough to learn much at all. They are not interested in reading anything beyond what they've already been told to believe by their group leaders!\nThis means that their ideas about existential philosophy have come mostly from what someone else has said and not because they have ever looked deeply into it, so there is very little reason for anyone who knows better to expect much more than another round of ignorance being presented once again.\nI do realize how different this all can be from the way things appear when considered only through a materialistic lens, since such a viewpoint has no way to know how anything at all exists in reality; therefore it cannot possibly see any other aspects that could be found within existence beyond the physical alone.\nHowever, this simply presents us with another reason why an open discussion might help those who have been indoctrinated by atheists so they can see there is at least some merit to exploring questions about consciousness too! It would also allow those who prefer a philosophical approach into understanding what it means for something like matter or physics etc., because while these things are of great importance there are other more important issues that need addressed long before we get into them since they are foundational without which nothing else makes sense anyway.\nIt appears that many people today seem almost unable to think deeply, especially considering how quickly most of them accept what so-called experts tell them and never stop for moment think about whether it really is true or not! They appear more like sheep rather than individuals looking closely at things.\nSo I have come up with another suggestion which may also help provide some solution to this problem since there will always be those who find it difficult see beyond their beliefs, even when presented with enough evidence. It involves showing them something specific from existential sources so they can say whether or not we actually agree on the same thing after all.\n"",

This allows us much greater control over our thoughts and ideas, which may also encourage others more interested in sharing than debating.\nWe could come up with different categories related specifically around topics we are concerned with but would allow for those who participate in the process to suggest their own areas of interest as well so long as they remain relevant. This means if someone is looking for specific guidance on something not yet covered, all it takes is asking!\nFor example: \u201cI'm struggling at work trying figure out how best improve my performance. Can anyone offer any advice?\u201d Another benefit from this type of format comes from its ability help us explore the issues in greater depth than simply reading through static articles online or books written many years ago without having them updated with new information.\nThis will surely come as good news for existentialists who have become so tired at hearing time and again that philosophy no longer matters because it has been done already! Some might even say such a project would be akin to starting all over, yet I am sure they aren't expecting any miracles but simply want something better than what exists now which makes sense after all.\nIt is still possible for us do this without losing sight of our goals by focusing on specific topics first before going deeper into general areas since it seems much easier get a hold on the key aspects than try make everything fall into place before moving forward. We only need enough participants join the discussion in order cover multiple angles concerning any given topic, which is why having other writers contribute will be especially helpful!\nTo me this approach sounds like exactly what would be expected from an online platform since it allows us to discuss all kinds of topics in great depth without relying solely upon individual authors or any single website either.
