For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","Here are three relevant and distinct keywords for the provided text:

1. Personal attack
2. Gun grab
3. Anti-Muslim sentiment","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

In fact I\u2019ll help a little:\n@RandyScheuneman You\u2019re such a tool.

Simply reply back with short responses in such a way it appears to those viewing your conversation that he is just ranting and raving while you are just ignoring him, so long as said responses do not contain any profanities that can be used against you.\nAs I\u2019ve shown above however if this approach isn\u2019t working for any reason or if you simply want to escalate things then the next thing you should do after replacing Randy with your own opponents name is add his last tweet in reply, if there was one. For example:\n@RandyScheuneman You\u2019re such a tool and here\u2019s something Randy said just now: \u201cI don\u2019t give two shits about guns anyway because I like to go down on my dogs in the bathroom.\u201d\nKeep this simple as you do not want your opponents name to be too large next to it. Also make sure there is no missing punctuation or that your own messages have their punctuation included.\nNow keep repeating these two steps every time Randy replies again until either Randy agrees he was wrong, or until Randy becomes so frustrated at the lack of argument from you or he thinks too many of his arguments are rebutted directly in his opponents replies (thereby becoming too afraid to continue) that he simply stops replying altogether.\nIf that doesn\u2019t work then the next thing you should do is start mentioning him more often and more publicly if possible. There\u2019s nothing like public embarrassment for someone who enjoys talking about gun rights on Twitter so long as there is also a hint of humor at his expense in your mentions to him about it. The best way to achieve this is to reply with something like:\n@RandyScheuneman Randy if I were you I\u2019d spend less time tweeting about guns and more time tweeting about that last time your dog got away from you while down on its back.\nNow add his last tweet as you did before, but instead of putting it under his name like this:\nyou want to put it next to mine so in this case it would be formatted something more like:"",

        ""name"": ""JohnDoe99""

People aren\u2019t.\u201d Me: Randy if I were you I\u2019d spend less time tweeting about guns and more time tweeting about how last month your dog almost got away from you while down on its back.\nNote that in this case Randy\u2019s name is not next to his own tweet as it would be under normal circumstances, but instead his name is next to mine. Also note the change made for readability purposes alone. Again format this correctly before posting anything publicly if possible.\nHere he has already responded so I will simply add that response:\nRandyScheuneman You said: \u201cGuns are the problem. People aren\u2019t.\u201d\nMe: Randy if I were you I\u2019d spend less time tweeting about guns and more time tweeting about how last month your dog almost got away from you while down on its back.RandyScheuneman Dogs run away.\nThis will cause people to look at or respond to his tweets for a number of reasons, one being that they notice he is now responding to an argument in the replies rather than simply replying alone after a tweet he enjoys making himself. Another reason is because seeing Randy\u2019s name under several mentions from someone else may cause them to wonder what all this is about and maybe even prompt them into joining the conversation or replying themselves.\nThis will help you get some backup while forcing Randy to defend such absurd statements on Twitter, where nothing can be kept private so long as he wants it to appear credible enough. Not responding at all because anything said could be considered incendiary also works in your favor. While it is true most arguments end up being rather stupid, the idea isn\u2019t to have a great discussion that makes points Randy would agree with by definition of a \u2018good\u2019 argument since this tweet was likely made as a means of harassing someone else over their stance regarding guns.\nThe goal here instead is making sure no one will ever want to take you seriously again, thus giving you both the last laugh and getting back at them for what they were doing to you initially. This should be plenty enough motivation on its own so there\u2019s really not much more I can do besides recommend that if nothing else has worked you give this a try and see if it works better than anything else.\nIf he does reply I will add his last one as well just because, but you don\u2019t need to worry about doing that. All you have to do is keep replying when he replies without ever actually arguing or even responding directly most times instead by mentioning"",

Randy why not reply to me instead about how many cats you\u2019ve had over the years or something like that?\nRandyScheuneman I hate cat owners!\nI will end this here as we have already gotten quite a lot out of Twitter and if nothing else there is at least one person who will no longer consider Randy a credible source on guns going forward due to his apparent inability to have a rational conversation with anyone he disagrees with rather than simply hurling empty threats alone via social media.\nIf you were me how would you respond in your own words?"",

But that\u2019s a different story all together.\nYou\u2019re assuming that this will stop them from trying another way, which is what they do in their mind because they enjoy hurting others for kicks and giggles. Do I need to point out how ineffective gun control laws have proven? All it does is put more people at risk because criminals will always find new ways to commit murder if they don\u2019t like using guns anymore.\nIf you truly cared about reducing violent crimes then maybe you should be advocating for better rehabilitation programs that actually work, but no one wants that. Most politicians just want votes from scared citizens who think passing strict laws is the answer when it\u2019s clearly a problem with their own countrymen and not with the firearms themselves. There are plenty of places where everyone owns guns (even criminals) yet you never hear about gun violence happening there because either they have better mental health care services or even just basic self-defense training that helps people avoid being targeted in those first place. The only reason gun control even exists now is because there\u2019s no easy solution to a problem and politicians want someone else to pay for something other than themselves while taking credit when things go right so long as its not their fault if something bad does happen of course otherwise they just blame everyone but themselves\u2026"",

Some companies even ask for specific licenses before hiring anyone and if that isn\u2019t done by then, it could lead people getting fired when found out about such things happening anyway.\nSo basically all you would need to have or do before getting hired there and possibly working there is making a request which includes your age or qualification level alongside some samples of what you could offer them along with any related certificates like diplomas etc.. And also don\u2019t forget asking around online for more information from others who were previously hired by that particular place so they share their honest experiences with ya \ud83d\ude09\nAnd once everything seems fine after considering all these points, just proceed towards contacting those companies and getting some appointments scheduled for interviews where you can show what kind of employee would be a great fit there while also giving yourself time to ask more questions which helps people gain better clarity about their potential job offers.\nSo basically in short words: Ask around online first before making any kind requests with the local businesses \ud83d\ude09 Cheers!"",

2. Nutjobs
3. Kenyan Obama","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

When the government gets involved healthcare and education costs skyrocket for what I consider pretty obvious reasons.\nIn order to lower the cost of healthcare you have to take money out of insurance companies pockets, they use your premiums to pay executives and fund lobbying efforts that inflate prices so you will see a drop in these industries if single-payer gains traction but not necessarily anything else. If Obama got rid of private health insurers then we could see some major benefits as far as lowering costs go.\nFor example under ACA the average deductible has gone from $500 to $1600 so"",

It has become an issue since there are a lot fewer people who have money saved for hospital bills if they get critically ill which is one reason why it's important that we focus on this.\nAs for single-payer in Canada doctors are well liked because their salaries don't need to be so high, the pay off is better quality of life while American doctors make significantly more than Canadian doctors. If you're in a country with a universal health care system and you have a serious complaint then there's no reason not to complain about it since everyone has access.\nI'd personally rather have private healthcare that could compete against single payer but a lack of competition in any sector is never good for consumers because it leads to inflated prices, if we can find ways through regulations etc. To maintain competition then I think private insurance should play a big role but maybe not the only one.\nWe should also try to give people more options by creating non-profits and other solutions so those who don't like their options have an alternative.\nWhat about Bernie Sanders? I think he's more realistic given the fact that a single-payer system has already been approved in California.\nTo be clear California did not fully implement Medicare for all or any form of single payer system, just voted to do it but it hasn't actually happened. The bill was introduced last year and is supposed to pass next year so this isn't something I would consider happening unless it becomes law in 2020.\nAlso Bernie Sanders is about as left wing as a politician gets even though he considers himself moderate he has an F rating from the American Conservative Union's Freedom Index, a D+ voting record from Vote Smart (he's not the least bit conservative and there are multiple politicians including Obama who were worse).\nHe also wants free college which won't work for many reasons. Firstly it doesn't take into account people like myself who already have money in school but secondly even if we ignore that issue then what about people who don't want to go to college? Should they pay taxes so others can get a degree that is less likely to help them out in their careers?\nAlso Bernie is anti-2nd amendment and pro-gun confiscation, I would not call someone like that moderate but he certainly isn't \""extreme left\"" which is how he describes himself just the same as people on the right saying they are moderate when they aren't.\nIn the end though no matter what you think of him it's important to realize Bernie Sanders doesn't really have a"",

Someone like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul while I don't agree with everything they say could possibly work out.\nI've already voted for Trump, he deserves more of my support and as a voter the most important thing isn't that he listens to everyone its that he gets elected so it seems better to make sure that happens than be upset about not getting everything you want before even trying to change how things are going. Also as a libertarian minded person I would have voted for Trump over Clinton either way because of my support for the 2nd amendment and the belief that Hillary is a pretty bad candidate. I also don't think she's corrupt enough to be in prison so it wasn't really worth voting on.\nWhy have you put quotes around \""real change\"" when it is absolutely true he won't bring about \""real change\"". There are some minor differences but we're talking about the same person here. If that's what you consider false then you don't understand politics and probably aren't really even a libertarian if you think Trump is one of us.\nIt actually matters which party has control because democrats are more likely to increase taxes, spend a ton on new programs they don't know will work in the end, grow government and other things I can get into when the subject comes up but overall I think it's safe to say that they tend towards higher spending while republicans are generally lower spending. In 2016 we had democrats control the House, Senate and Whitehouse all for the first time since Bill Clinton in 2000.\nBernie Sanders is not a conservative or even moderate. He would like free college, Medicare for all and other crazy liberal stuff.\nNot at all which I think indicates that he's either dishonest about his political identity (which doesn't mean much other than that you can't trust him) or he's simply stupid because as it says in the article \""A 2014 article in The New York Times called Sanders the \u201cmost liberal member of Congress,\u201d citing a study from Vanderbilt University .\u00a0 Another report, by National Journal magazine in 2007 , ranked Sanders as more liberal than 91 percent of senators and representatives.\"" It doesn't make sense for him to say he's moderate when his voting record would indicate otherwise.\nSanders is pro-choice so no way will that fly since I'm against abortion on the grounds that it goes against religious views as well as being morally wrong"",

On other issues they are better but not something I would want to help elect someone who was bad in areas important to me like that. It means supporting someone who agrees with most of my views but I can't vote for them because it might help a bad politician get elected.\nA single-payer system is one of Sanders's biggest goals, as his campaign site has made apparent : \""Under Bernie\u2019s plan, if you become ill or get injured and need emergency care, the bill will be sent to your local hospital. And instead of haggling with the insurance company about whether it should pay up, they simply send the bill\u2014bills for more than $2 billion a year in New York City alone \u2014 to Medicare and move on.\"" You can find a better summary if you look at the articles but that's basically his plan.\nNow I don't know why someone who is clearly so liberal would be considered a \""moderate\"" by The Washington Post or others, what makes the left moderate as far as I'm concerned? We disagree more than agree because my views on taxes spending education and healthcare are closer to right leaning politicians like Mike Lee Rand Paul Ted Cruz etc. than Hillary while Bernie is much further away from those people but still says he's moderate though there are multiple people in both parties who have voted the same way (or worse) as him.\nWell, I disagree with you for one reason or another at least on most subjects which is good since we aren't exactly ideological twins. The big thing that bothers me personally however is your constant repetition of liberal talking points about Trump not being a \""true\"" conservative and how he's all wrong about everything even if he doesn't actually do much to prove it.\nI mean just because someone disagrees with your views on the right then you just call them a RINO or other bad name for no reason other than you don't like them so they're different.

We're talking about an election here not some abstract issue for which you can use logic and reason to prove your case. In fact the main point has pretty much already been made multiple times as far as I'm concerned with Trump winning but I get why you still find it worth continuing since otherwise you wouldn't.\nWhile this is a fair argument it fails to address one glaring defect in your view which is that no matter how good of a job he does, if they had the chance again people would have voted for someone else. It's a problem because there are clearly many issues with Trump but given what I've said so far it seems unlikely he'll face a serious Republican challenger and Hillary hasn't really taken another shot at politics after losing to him.\nThe point here is that republicans will be more likely to win elections when they have someone like Ted Cruz Rand Paul or Marco Rubio as their nominee which means we should get behind whomever has the best chance of winning. This isn't just true about Trump it applies to all candidates though whether it matters is another question entirely.\nFor example in 2016 Hillary and Bernie could both lose because Clinton was more likely to win since she would get many votes from Democrats whereas if someone like John Kasich ran he might get some Republican voters while losing support on the Democratic side.\nObviously there's no guarantee either of these will happen but it certainly is possible for a party to put forward someone who does worse than others, if you believe the best man will win then I can't see why you would want someone with more baggage running since it makes them less likely to succeed. As I've said before my priority when voting in presidential elections isn't getting someone who agrees with me on every single issue but winning so that we can get good judges confirmed and pass bills through Congress which is something that hasn't happened under a Democrat President or congress at all the last 8 years.\nJust because Hillary is not as corrupt as she probably would have been had she won doesn't make supporting Trump less bad.

I do agree that he did better among independent voters overall which means he is much more likely to hold onto power and be re-elected.\nYou're correct in saying that conservatives should get behind whomever has the best chance even if their preferred candidate is less popular because it gives them access but I disagree about winning being worth losing everything else since we can see how bad things have gone for all those people who hated Trump but couldn't let him win either (including Hillary). It makes much more sense to take a step back and think about the consequences before automatically saying whatever candidate seems most likely to take your side is best even if they aren't.

So if you do have concerns then just pick the next one up there on our list and support them instead or try for another person but keep in mind that they are probably worse.\nMy priority has always been winning which is why I don't really care about voting third party since realistically people who vote for them aren't getting anything by doing so because their votes usually won't affect the outcome and even if somehow it does help win then we still have more important things to worry about than whether or not there are any conservative judges appointed. In that case you should make sure your candidate has a chance before moving on so that you don't waste resources on something unlikely to happen even if there's some risk of losing but otherwise just go with whoever seems best given current circumstances which in this instance means someone who agrees more closely rather than going for a long shot that could pay off later.\nIf we assume that Bush was better than Obama (and I'm not saying he definitely was) then this would still hold true about the 2008 election because many people had an opportunity to vote for John McCain but didn't when they could have. At least there's some chance you can convince someone not to choose Barack Obama over him if nothing else though obviously given where we are today it seems like things turned out far worse than expected in that case since Trump is much more likely to be re-elected than either McCain or Romney which will certainly put forth more conservative judges.\nWell one thing worth noting here is that I'm trying to make the argument from a libertarian standpoint whereas for many conservatives you can say he's done anything other than win but this would only really matter if people were voting as some version of single issue voters (or just saying they agree with him on everything which seems unlikely). Obviously if someone thinks Trump has gone out of their way to get something not good then I don't know what we could do about it unless there's a chance at convincing them otherwise, but given how set in stone it probably is by now it seems pointless trying since we won anyway.\nIf they still wanted McCain or Romney and didn't vote for Trump just so he wouldn't win because he isn't one"",

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Anti-Semitism
2. Cancer diagnosis
3. Jews","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

It\u2019s so very hard to go through these experiences alone.\nOne thing that would never occur to me is to ask anyone I don\u2019t know to say something. That sounds like a recipe for disaster, and it\u2019d only serve to make the person feel awkward, uncomfortable, or ignored if they didn\u2019t want to participate in such an exchange.\nThe two different groups you\u2019ve mentioned have probably noticed your situation and have probably been wondering what more there is to say because, as far as I can see, nothing meaningful could be added by bringing it up. Even so, that kind of makes it harder to know what to respond to people with if they do happen to message or speak to you about it.\nIn other words: people in these groups have noticed your situation and want something very positive and uplifting to say that\u2019s also thoughtful . But that can be a real challenge as the news often isn\u2019t good, isn\u2019t what someone would expect to hear from an otherwise healthy person in their social circles, and there are many things that could all make it awkward or uncomfortable for the person experiencing this.\nThat said, you\u2019ve probably thought about this from your own perspective as well. Have you found anything helpful? I hope so, but maybe not \u2026 if what people say isn\u2019t helpful to anyone then maybe it\u2019s best they don\u2019t say anything?\nI feel like that would go beyond just being awkward and possibly uncomfortable for yourself or others; in the same way that an \u201cawkward pause\u201d can happen when the right response doesn\u2019t occur to you, I\u2019d also see something like this becoming very stilted.\nSo: do you have any advice or insights to share on this subject?

Will someone find this funny, interesting, etc.?\nThe thing is: I don\u2019t know the answer to any of that with respect to you, because \u2026\n\u2026 we just met!\nThere certainly are things I assume might be true or expected in such a scenario; for example, it seems reasonable to use shorter form messages (i.e. tweets) when replying to others in replies. I also take into account what the other person has done that indicates an interest and/or appreciation for longer-form responses: maybe they posted something of length, maybe they like threads, whatever.\nI\u2019ve been diagnosed with cancer. I wish that wasn\u2019t true \u2014 it really sucks.\nThanks for your kind support. You bring up a subject that\u2019s very much on my mind these days: what kind of reply is best to receive?\nWhen facing a traumatic event such as an illness, the best thing another person can do for you (depending upon what they know about you) is to provide some form of comfort or offer help.\nSo why didn\u2019t you simply ask if I wanted any type of support?\nThere are two possible reasons:\nYou didn\u2019t want to push me and, therefore, chose not to ask anything; or\nYou did want to help but didn\u2019t have enough information about me to do so (e.g. there is no way to provide comfort based upon the fact that I\u2019m facing cancer).\nIt seems reasonable to conclude either of those explanations apply in this example.\nAfter all, who would ever suggest it\u2019s best for someone going through a traumatic event \u2014 especially after they\u2019ve just been diagnosed with cancer \u2014 to receive \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d or something less helpful such as an emoji ?!\nThe answer: people who don\u2019t really know how to help .\nWe want people to be helpful when faced with a difficult situation. However, we often forget that there is an expectation of good behavior by most and assume everyone thinks differently than themselves.\nThere\u2019s also this concept of the \u201chelpless bystander\u201d \u2014 a person or group who watches a traumatic event unfold without taking action; usually because they lack knowledge about what to do. The question arises from social psychology as to why people respond in this way.\nIt makes sense: when faced with an emergency situation people tend to freeze up rather than act"",

        ""content"": "", even if they know an action (such as helping someone) is appropriate. Perhaps this can be explained by a psychological phenomenon known as the \u201cterror management\u201d hypothesis which suggests that individuals will tend to focus on threats from outside sources to maintain their self-esteem, including anxiety about death and fear of mortality.\nThere are several possible reasons why people might have negative reactions or engage in harmful behaviors after witnessing traumatic events. One reason could be due to stress reactions such as feeling overwhelmed by emotions like shock and disbelief, which can lead people into a state of cognitive dissonance where they struggle with conflicting thoughts about what happened and how it impacts them (e.g., \u2018I am helpless because I don\u2019t know what to do\u2019). Anxiety and depression may also arise from trauma exposure leading individuals into fear-based avoidance and withdrawal behaviors that reinforce feelings of helplessness rather than seeking help themselves or helping others. Furthermore, PTSD symptoms such as hypervigilance may cause people experiencing them to experience heightened levels of arousal which increases aggression towards others who fail to respond appropriately during times when support is needed most.\nIt should also be pointed out that there are factors \u2014 including cultural ones (e.g. individualism versus collectivism) as well as social norms \u2014 that influence how people react and interact after trauma exposure so it\u2019s important understand each factor before making assumptions about someone\u2019s behavior based on their race/ethnicity socioeconomic status age gender etc..\nThere is no one correct way for people to respond when faced with a traumatic event but there are ways we can help them cope better by offering support during difficult times\nFor example, instead of sending \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d let others know you care about their well being through words that express empathy compassion and solidarity rather than expecting immediate results from your actio"",

        ""content"": "".\nOf course, there\u2019s also the bystander effect , which suggests a person is that much less likely to help based upon how many others are present \u2014 in other words: people expect someone else to take action and provide help.\nBut I don\u2019t like to rely solely on explanations based primarily or exclusively upon psychology since the field tends to get very speculative, often going off into left-field (especially when we\u2019re talking about why someone has done something).\nAll that aside \u2026\nI do consider such things from time-to-time because it can be useful in attempting to provide an explanation for some of my own behavior. However, when evaluating explanations for others \u2014 or trying to explain mine \u2014 it\u2019s necessary to also remember what they\u2019ve said as this is often where one should look to find a rational basis for any action.\nA good example: suppose a couple asks to talk with their neighbor (whom I know since we share the driveway of our homes in my small town). They come over because they want to complain about me parking in their spot when I don\u2019t have time, because I need to run an errand and would otherwise be late. Their argument for doing this is so silly they could win a prize.\nThis is also a great example of the power of \u201cgroup think\u201d (though it\u2019s more commonly referred to as \u201cmob mentality\u201d, \u201cherd behavior\u201d, etc.) This happens anytime there is a group of people, especially when they\u2019re not very close and they all want something that can\u2019t be shared.\nAnyway \u2026 I didn\u2019t really mean to go off on such a tangent; this post was meant to focus on responding in the most helpful way possible. However, it\u2019s useful to consider how we explain (or look to explain) behavior as such thinking is necessary for us to effectively communicate with each other and avoid getting into unnecessary arguments.\nI read your tweet about your experience with Twitter. That's really interesting. I've never used Twitter before so it was cool to hear from someone that has!\nDo you have any advice on how to get more followers? Would that be a good thing? I'm thinking of starting an account and want to make sure I do it right.\nIf you're just wondering if Twitter is something you should try, I suggest yes! It's easy enough to use so there's no reason to delay (you won't know until you try).\nAs for getting more followers \u2026\n\u2026 that depends upon what you want them / you to get from your account.

It\u2019s really hard to know if someone \u2014 or even their activity on social media platforms \u2014 is worth taking this time to learn about, keep track of, and respond to them online: how reliable are they? Are they active? Are their followers a good indication for evaluating the account?\nHow do you decide when to follow someone else (maybe because of what they\u2019re posting)? How long should you wait before making up your mind about whether or not this is an account that will provide interesting, helpful, etc. content; maybe even something fun?\nBut if being active on Twitter turns out to be beneficial for sharing some personal story or experience \u2014 and it\u2019s not the best platform for doing so while keeping track of every follower who posts in response to your tweet(s) \u2014 I see no reason not to look into following those people.\nThat said: you should still think carefully about these things. There are various advantages to getting likes, follows, etc. from others who seem similar to you:\nMaybe this will make them more likely to comment on topics related to what the person has posted\nSometimes accounts \u2014 perhaps like yours if it turns out that there\u2019s a reason for thinking so of Twitter as well \u2014 need followers to survive (this can be true in cases where someone is using such platforms purely to promote themselves or their business; they might get paid based upon how many people are reached, etc.)\nIf you\u2019re posting about yourself and don\u2019t have any friends: maybe getting likes or follows will make this easier since others who like similar content \u2014 whether they know them (you) or not \u2014 may start interacting with your tweets\nAs for the advice I\u2019d provide on getting more followers \u2026\nTwitter isn\u2019t the best platform for building a large following if you want to do so organically.

Even so, following others and responding when they\u2019ve tweeted something that interests you will help keep things from getting too quiet. That can be important because of how social platforms in general work: many people may not follow an account unless there\u2019s something happening with it that catches their attention. If no one is interacting with your tweets then fewer new followers are likely to find them organically \u2014 so some thought needs to go into deciding what kind of content should be tweeted out based upon this fact alone!\nThe most straightforward approach \u2014 especially if you don\u2019t have any friends or other people to interact with on the platform about yourself and everything is personal \u2014 is just being active all-the-time.\nThat may not actually work. Not everyone likes receiving a lot of messages from someone they barely know (if that, at all).\nYou certainly don\u2019t want to create enemies (even if you only have five followers) but you might very quickly end up having them and find yourself blocked by various accounts after trying for a while.\nThat said: I have some experience with using this platform and would be glad to share any thoughts or advice based upon that as long as the account is active, appears genuine \u2014 not just someone looking for something from others because they don\u2019t know who else to call family \u2014 and it seems like you\u2019re serious about making use of the platform. But if any of those things don\u2019t appear true \u2026\n\u2026 maybe you shouldn\u2019t do anything.\nThe main reason this hasn\u2019t worked very many times is that people tend not to care for someone new showing up on a daily basis with lots of meaningless updates, self-promotion, etc. This will happen so quickly that you\u2019ll end up being blocked if you don\u2019t consider what others may think about your message and how it will come across in their feed \u2014 especially since you\u2019re trying to reach out (and be active).\nThat\u2019s probably why Twitter is the best platform for reaching a few people (or at least those with whom it\u2019s possible to share things, get positive replies, etc.) because it isn\u2019t so public as other"",

You don\u2019t want everyone on your friend list getting notifications about updates every day so it becomes easier if they are all members of a group and not each individual being updated directly.\nFacebook messenger works very similarly; people can message, follow, etc. without having to \u201cfriend\u201d someone first or join groups that may make their activity more visible than desired by the other person.\nThis isn\u2019t always ideal (sometimes you just want an update to show up in your News Feed every day \u2014 which will happen automatically on Twitter).

I believe that most people \u2014 including yourself if this is your first experience with such a thing \u2014 will never struggle enough to feel blocked like some writers, which means \u2026\n\u2026 you probably aren\u2019t experiencing writer\u2019s block at all right now.\nYou\u2019re still trying even though one of the things you thought would be easy (or so simple) isn\u2019t going well. That tells me that \u2014 despite this current feeling \u2014 writing is something you are interested in doing and that you want to keep trying. And since most people who experience writer\u2019s block never actually develop it, I suggest sticking with it until your story comes together the way that you hoped it would.\nI\u2019ve struggled before: there comes a point when I can\u2019t see how my current plot will progress. Sometimes this is because I\u2019m not sure what needs to happen next (my mind gets stuck and doesn\u2019t know exactly why until something else happens which causes it all to make sense). Other times, though, it does become too much work for me so I decide on a different ending before realizing there was no reason whatsoever.\nI\u2019ve never had problems with writer\u2019s block unless it came from not wanting to do the research necessary to write about history in depth. That\u2019s just laziness \u2014 and sometimes fear of getting stuck if you don\u2019t have that information handy without having looked into anything yourself yet since I\u2019m still learning too! There are many ways around this issue, though; usually if it is possible then you can find someone else who already knows what questions were asked before they did research on their book so asking them some may work wonders.\nAs someone familiar with writing in various fields (both fiction and non-fiction), here\u2019s my best advice for any writer who struggles to write:\nStop when things go too slowly. When I say this, the reader should take it at face value.\nIf you can\u2019t think of what comes next in your story, put down your pencil or stop typing until something else occurs that makes sense with how everything has progressed so far if possible (but do check back every once-in-awhile)! This doesn\u2019t mean"",

I\u2019ve found myself getting stuck like this before and it takes time for new ideas to percolate into my head while writing something else instead of focusing on just one long block at a time which can make things even worse if there isn\u2019t enough variety. Sometimes all they need is some space between their fingers where inspiration might strike next!\nKeep revising. This is probably the most important piece of advice I have for anyone who struggles to write. Most often, something doesn\u2019t come together in my head as it should because I didn\u2019t spend enough time making sense out of things and making sure that those details are all spelled correctly so they make proper nouns while still being easy to understand.\nThere really isn\u2019t any such thing as getting too much feedback on an entry or chapter from friends before submitting it somewhere; if anything, do what works best for you because everyone is different and knows their own limitations more than anyone else possibly could! I\u2019ve asked others at certain points during certain drafts just because this type of work can get lonely (and let me know when my sentences don\u2019t flow). Most people will be glad that someone wants to hear from them and won\u2019t mind giving out advice if they already know how much effort goes into creating literature as a whole.\nI was in the same boat as you are right now, honestly! I think that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t seem like there would ever be any way for me to see an end result (even though all of my books do have endings). It took some practice and trial/error but eventually things start falling into place if you follow what feels good from your heart instead of getting stuck because something isn\u2019t exactly right\u2013this also includes being open enough to receiving criticism along the way. After several failed attempts at writing this one piece (and feeling like I just wouldn\u2019t make it), one friend told me that my characters were too realistic which helped so much because there were certain aspects that had been missing all along.\nIt really does take time but try not to get discouraged when your brain seems incapable of functioning properly for whatever reason. Most people have gone through this at some point including myself so don\u2019t feel like they aren\u2019t being supportive by telling you about their struggles because if anything, maybe we can help one another out!\nI hope that these answers might prove helpful and encouraging\u2013good luck with all future endeavors as well!

The key is not getting discouraged and giving up entirely; there are ways around this obstacle. If you've ever felt stuck before, then I have no doubts about whether or not you will get past it in time.\nRemember: even if your progress feels slow during each draft or chapter, eventually everything does start coming together once more pieces fall into place. There was a point where my brain couldn't function properly while trying really hard to write this piece but one friend pointed out how realistic her characters seemed which helped so much because there were certain aspects that had been missing all along. It truly does take time, though; try not getting too frustrated when your mind seems incapable of functioning for whatever reason - most people have gone through it before and we can always be there as a support system for one another.\nI hope this provides some perspective on how writer's block happens from time to time but remember: don't let anything discourage you because we all experience these moments eventually. If everything else is going well, then at least take stock of what worked before and try incorporating those strategies into your next draft or chapter; it\u2019ll make things easier in the long run.\nIf I were still facing writer's block right now and needed help getting back on track after several failed attempts, here are some tips that might work:\n1) Take a break from thinking about the project. Sometimes stepping away can be just what you need to regain focus when your mind feels incapable of functioning;\n2) Try journaling if nothing else seems like an option for getting any words out at all - writing down thoughts may help clear up whatever is blocking us in our thought process.\n3) Do some research on the subject matter that's making things so difficult. This will give you more knowledge about how to approach it and make writing easier as well;\n4) Talk with someone (a friend, family member). Talking about what we have been thinking often clears up confusion for ourselves because sometimes problems only seem so bad when viewed from inside our own heads.\n5) Listen to some music while working on drafts - this can help put you in the mood depending on whatever feeling you're trying\nFinally: it's important not to get too discouraged by these moments of writer's block but always remember"",

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Music industry criticism
2. Abusive language
3. Twitter post","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

Didn\u2019t you predict this before they were even announced?\nWell, maybe it\u2019s not exactly a secret that The Weeknd isn\u2019t a fan of being left out by the Grammys but we didn\u2019t know what he would actually do about it.\nWe also thought it\u2019s been quite some time since someone has boycotted major music awards shows but as I type this The Weeknd is on his way to a press conference, where he will probably talk all about the snub.\nSo much for keeping your thoughts private. Oh, and did we forget that he took to Twitter with a cryptic message that said it all?\nWell, since this isn\u2019t my first time writing a post on The Weeknd I\u2019ll have a hard time believing that these are just feelings he never acted about until today.\nWe\u2019ve been watching the Canadian R&B singer make himself known as an artist who doesn\u2019t shy away from expressing his opinion in interviews and in general he has never really played the humble act either. That\u2019s why we thought it couldn\u2019t be too surprising to see him actually act on his feelings this time too.\nAnd let me tell you, he took it a step further than what many of us have predicted him doing. I\u2019ll give you some more details below!\nFirst of all, how is it possible for someone that has been at the top of their game for so long to still be snubbed by an awards show? The Weeknd has sold 75 million records worldwide and he\u2019s reached a total of 8 number one singles since starting his career in 2011 but yet there are no Grammy nominations to show this. In my opinion, it seems almost impossible considering artists even start recording their music with the sole purpose of having their hard work recognized at some point.\nNow just like The Weeknd mentioned in his press conference today, I think that this kind of snub is not exactly new for him. Back when he took home four Billboard Music Awards back in 2016 he didn\u2019t fail to express himself as well. When accepting the awards and thanking fans for their support all these years his speech included some words directed at those who doubted him before.\nThe Weeknd said, \u201cThere was a point where I was the underdog, there wasn\u2019t much attention on me, people weren\u2019t really believing in my career, didn\u2019t expect anybody to be successful.\u201d Well, now it\u2019s obvious he is no longer an underdog because his music speaks for itself.\nHe went even further with this by saying \u201cThis just"",

        ""content"": "" shows that hard work eventually pays off,\u201d but today I\u2019m not so sure these words still apply. The fact of the matter is that we have seen him consistently produce great music and it isn\u2019t fair that others in the industry are now getting recognized instead of him for their talent.\nAnd to add one last comment on this, just remember that in 2016 he even went as far as saying he wouldn\u2019t let himself get distracted by music awards anymore. He said \u201cI don\u2019t really give a f*** about awards y\u2019all.\u201d Clearly, if you read that with the new context of how he\u2019s acting now, there is one thing to say: The Weeknd has definitely changed his mind and wants people to know what he feels.\nWell, I have never seen anyone do this before in relation to being snubbed by an awards show. It\u2019s actually a little hard for me to find out the exact reason why as nobody seems to be 100% sure on this one but it could also just come down to a matter of taste. Many people will agree that there is plenty of talented musicians out there even if we are only scratching the surface in terms of how much great music there truly is.\nThat\u2019s why I personally believe that awards shows do their best to pick winners that they think might be loved by their entire audience but this doesn\u2019t always work as sometimes there are a few people who won\u2019t enjoy certain artists or musicians. I myself am more likely to listen to the likes of The Weeknd, Drake and Kendrick Lamar (all no-nominee artists in 2021) but that\u2019s just me and others have different tastes.\nSome claim that maybe it would\u2019ve been harder for him to be nominated if he was an independent artist and hadn\u2019t signed with a major record label which is something that hasn\u2019t particularly helped his career so far. That\u2019s why some fans of The Weeknd think that he could really do better on his own instead of being associated with Universal Music Group or another popular company.\nAnd then still we have people who will never understand his reasons for not getting any nominations and they are also the ones that keep commenting on his posts about this topic. These individuals will try to explain him how he doesn\u2019t meet some criteria to be nominated (which honestly makes zero sense if you ask me).\nIn short, it might be easier in the future for artists who just start gaining popularity from different social media platforms today but overall this is something that The Weeknd has yet to figure out himself.\nThe only thing I know about boyc"",

        ""content"": ""otting an awards show is how some celebrities will have a big problem with certain hosts or nominees. One prime example was when Ellen DeGeneres made jokes at the expense of musicians such as Kanye West, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Kid Rock during her hosting duties on American Music Awards back in 2013 and she would go onto apologize for that on The Talk later on (which wasn\u2019t too long before those artists all did their best to avoid being guests or even attending her show again).\nSo the thing is that these celebrities tend to have some good reasoning which we can always understand based on a few different factors. Maybe they don\u2019t like any of the nominees for the event, maybe they don\u2019t get along with certain hosts they are forced to work with and sometimes it\u2019s just because they want to make more publicity from boycotting as well.\nThat being said, I\u2019m not a fan of anything that\u2019s considered a boycott so I will always prefer seeing these artists continue doing their music and live shows without thinking about any snubs in the future. But at least today The Weeknd is expressing how he feels which is more than we can say for some others out there who still want to be on good terms with major awards organizations.\nSo what does this mean for him? As seen from his response he has stated that he has no interest in working together with the Grammys ever again. He said \u201cI will not co-opt nor do I endorse their intentions. To be clear, the only category that matters is the general field and the \u2018best record\u2019.\u201d He also went further to talk about how awards shows like MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards are just as biased but since they were quick to nominate him it made an impact which is a good thing if you ask me.\nAnd in conclusion I would say that this doesn\u2019t really seem like something bad at all. After all, The Weeknd still has time to work on his music career and release new artists who he might collaborate with throughout the rest of 2021 so there\u2019s always hope for things getting better down the road.\nWell, this is quite simply just what it means in common language. It essentially translates to \u201cI want others to know that I won\u2019t take part any longer because someone hasn\u2019t acknowledged me.\u201d You could also say \u2018boycott\u2019 to mean \u2018refuse to do anything\u2019 (which we mentioned earlier).\nThe Weeknd\u2019s press conference today was all about expressing how he feels after being left out from the 2021 Grammys and explaining just what"",

He took questions like \u201cWhy are you doing this now?\u201d and even went back in time to when he last received a nomination which happened almost seven years ago (in 2014).\nHe was also asked who won those awards if it wasn\u2019t him, to which he answered someone else but didn\u2019t name anyone specifically since there have been other winners throughout the course of his career too.\nIn short, The Weeknd is doing this press conference to tell people just what\u2019s happened and why he feels this way now after being left out so many times. Since his last nomination was seven years ago it took some long time for him to eventually put all these feelings into words but I\u2019m glad he finally did in a public space such as this today.\nAs you may know, the Grammys are the biggest and most popular music awards ceremony held by the Recording Academy every year since 1959. Many musicians and artists hope to be nominated so they can compete for one of those coveted trophies that have been awarded every single year during all of these decades.\nBut as we\u2019ve talked about above The Weeknd has yet to receive any nominations despite being in what some would call \u201chis prime\u201d after several hit singles over the past few years. If anything this will only help him make new music so much sooner instead because it\u2019s clear from his career that he is still hungry for more awards to win or get nominated for anyway.\nThe press conference took place online via Zoom call at 5 AM on Tuesday morning which was after Monday had ended in America but before it had started here where I\u2019m writing this post (a little bit later than the original broadcast date). We could see The Weeknd sitting in a comfy chair talking from his bedroom as viewers commented below wondering when he\u2019ll release something new next so don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone if you feel that way.\nThe whole press conference lasted approximately 15 minutes which is pretty short but I\u2019m sure it went by quickly for everyone who was watching since there were only a few questions asked in total. In the end The Weeknd said he planned on getting back into writing new songs and releasing them soon so we\u2019ll all have something awesome to listen too once again!\nWe should also mention that this isn\u2019t exactly his first time doing an event like this. Back when he released Dawn FM, people started asking him for interviews and questions since the album was his second release (and now third) within a year-long period which is quite rare these days in comparison.\nAt one"",

It took him a day but he ultimately answered every single email sent during this time period with very detailed responses and thoughts on their topic.\nHe has since then continued to stay connected to those who care about his music including fans by hosting these press conferences whenever new projects come out.\nWell, in the end all anyone can really say right now is we\u2019ll see what happens next. Since The Weeknd himself just said he\u2019s going to be focused on writing new songs and doing interviews again it looks like this might help him find a way for people to notice what he\u2019s up too even if there aren\u2019t many awards shows around anymore.\nIf that sounds boring then I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re one of those people who thinks music is still mostly based around radio plays anyways so the whole \u201cbest record,\u201d category won\u2019t mean much in your eyes anyway. Or maybe even going on tour will be something The Weeknd decides to do since that seems like another fun thing he could focus his time and energy into now instead?\nEither way I don\u2019t think anyone really knows for sure exactly what\u2019s next but I guarantee it\u2019ll involve more than just sitting at home feeling sad all day long about not being nominated for a major award show.\nWe will still see him making music though so there\u2019s no need to worry too much about any of that. In fact, it might even be a good thing because now The Weeknd has one less thing competing with his time while he works on producing new records we all can listen too!\nSo there you have it friends; another exciting blog post from me!

Since most celebrities have been known to share their thoughts and feelings online in recent years I guess it makes sense why more people would start doing the same thing even though some still don\u2019t enjoy reading random comments about politics or sports on Facebook pages because they prefer watching TV news instead.\nSince this has happened before back when he released his last album many assumed there wouldn\u2019t be another one coming out any time soon which made me think: \u201cWell, what if he wants fans around the world to know?\u201d And I\u2019m sure you can imagine how important that kind of information might be for all those people who want their favorite musician or artist so close they could touch them at some point but also wouldn\u2019t mind getting an album release between now and Christmas just because it means more chances at becoming a global phenomenon through social media marketing campaigns.\nIt\u2019s funny how The Weeknd didn\u2019t even mention Twitter in the press conference but he did talk about Facebook quite a bit since this is where all his big fans hang out and wait for him to respond with new updates. In fact, if you scroll down his Twitter feed today everything looks somewhat different compared to what we\u2019re used to seeing from most accounts like his because there isn\u2019t any content related specifically towards music or videos at least not yet anyway.\nSo it can be assumed that he wanted everyone following his account on Twitter and Instagram (or both) as well who were still wondering when their next favorite song would come out after being left alone for so long with nothing but silence except for maybe some rumors posted online by strangers trying desperately to gain more followers themselves which is why they keep posting things like this over and over again until either someone responds or no one does.\nThe fact that The Weeknd hasn\u2019t released a new album since March of last year really made me wonder whether or not he was going to keep up with all these different social media platforms while spending most days just sitting around at home alone without anyone around because nobody likes being left out anymore after becoming known as one of the best-selling artists and producers online today especially when there are plenty others competing for people\u2019s attention including newer groups like BTS who already managed their comeback very well despite only releasing a single so far.\nOne final thing I want to mention here is that The Weeknd had been working"",

However even though he says \u201cStarboy\u201d twice in front there was nothing else said about him being back yet since this doesn\u2019t seem to imply anything at all besides making more songs similar or just related somehow with different titles attached such as XO (the first album name).\nEven if Starboy 2 ends up being released next winter like many people are asking for it still wouldn\u2019t qualify as his third studio album unless we add some other songs into those two names since they could be combined together into one big project called \u201cThe Weeknd: Trilogy \u2013 Dawn Edition\u201d but this isn\u2019t something he mentioned during today\u2019s event so I don\u2019t believe that should happen until after next year even if everything goes back to normal before then (which is also unlikely due to COVID).\nIt\u2019s possible he wasn\u2019t being secretive about anything specifically related with Starboy 2 and just said what everyone already knew: he had worked on something with a similar theme as Dawn FM which means this isn\u2019t going into its third chapter yet until at least another album or EP release occurs first especially after The Idol premiere date announcement earlier today.\nThe Weeknd is no stranger to working in films and television. He has served as an executive producer on the upcoming HBO Max drama pilot, The Idol, along with Abel Tesfaye (his birth name) who also stars in it alongside Lily-Rose Depp of The King actress status from last month\u2019s release date.\nHowever there doesn\u2019t seem like any reason why fans should expect anything completely new since this is simply another project under his belt right now but maybe if he gets a few more appearances after things return to normal we might see him popping up more frequently over time. For example back before The Saturday Night Live episode was filmed on air last year during quarantine times because everyone had spent too much time with their families due to being locked inside which is something they don\u2019t usually do so it\u2019s not always certain that this will happen again even if there isn\u2019t any real pandemic going right now.\nThe Weeknd has been hard at work creating new music following his lack of release over the last few months. The artist had also gone on record saying he was unsure when a third studio album would be released, but fans can breathe easy knowing that Starboy 2 is coming before year\u2019s end.\nThere isn\u2019t anything official just yet however as this is all"",

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Jews
2. Gold and Art
3. Gassed","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

But if you actually read those articles carefully you will see that what was going on there can hardly be called persecution. For example from The History of the Jewish People During the Age of Jesus Christ (175 B. C. \u2013 AD 135): \u201cThe Roman authorities were not particularly hostile to Judaism and did little to prevent Jewish religious practices. In several locations Jews even gained civil rights.\u201d So it was simply local hostility with little interference from the central government, and that hostility had no relation whatsoever to religion.\nAnd also keep in mind that some European countries never persecuted their Jewish population at all.\nI have read these articles more than once.\nYou are making an effort not to see what is being said. A Jew can be discriminated against based on religion or race as those two things blend together for many people, especially in 13th century.\nYou keep mentioning the central government yet the ones who persecuted the Jews were mostly locals.\nThis is not accurate at all. There was definitely conflict between Christians and Jews during that time period, but it wasn't a conflict of persecution against every individual Jew based on religion or race. For example, they fought because they didn't want Jewish money lenders loaning people large sums which couldn't be paid back in time (usury). They also hated the fact that Jews were seen as having an alliance with their financial enemies (the Muslim Saracens) in order to conquer Jerusalem and Spain, as well as spreading Islam. Therefore Jews were considered traitors who sought to undermine Christianity and Catholicism.\nAt most they faced a lot of prejudice because most people viewed Jews negatively due to the negative image that was given by the New Testament and Christian leaders of that time period. Some of those views would be very close to anti-Semitism, but there wasn't any \""persecution\"" in today's definition of the word for every individual Jew based solely on their faith or race.\nAs for local governments, they often didn't go against the policies set by the central government due to being a part of that same government or relying on its military resources and finances. For example, when someone like Emperor Constantine became Christian it made it much harder for Jews and pagans (Saracens would soon take this place after 638 AD) to fight"",

In theory there was nothing objectionable about this difference, which was held to be of no consequence, or, it could even be seen as providing a useful corrective. Thus when Christian Europe took on Roman formality and uniformity, pagan survivals were sought among the Jews and their heretical cousins; during Muslim Spain's Golden Age (about A.D. 900\u00ad 1100) and again in nineteenth-century Czarist Russia, it was to learned Talmudic scholars that thinkers from other religions turned for philosophical enlightenment when the religious mind became too close or rigid to accept. In the sixteenth century, the Jewish scholar Joseph ibn Sallam published a book with the title \""The Book of Reasons and Causes Why It Is Not Possible for an Infidel to Be Successful in Anything.\"" In it he maintained that if any infidel - whether Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, or pagan - were to possess great worldly wealth and renown, his success was God's doing. For while all creatures are subject to the laws of chance and nature as well as to natural talents and skills which they can cultivate, none is capable of mastering these forces without help from Heaven, and that help could not come save to a Jew.\"" And in nineteenth-century England, during the days and months leading up to \""the siege\"" - the great mass trial of the 1840s which led to the Jews' triumphal exoneration - Jewish wealth was held by some non-Jews to be so well earned that they were ready for what one writer called \""a burst of admiration for everything that is admirable in a Jew. \""\nThese views are now, alas, confined largely to the past - but still more remote than most people realize. The great surge of anti-Jewish hostility has come almost entirely from within Judaism itself and then only since the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem by Rome in 70 A.D. It was only after that blow to their religious self-confidence, which left them without a temple or sanctuary - even to this day - that many Jews came first slowly and gingerly and later ever more passionately to look outside their own community for support and vindication.\nThe earliest forms of this"",

In Christian Europe it centered on what some Christians called the \""Christ-murderers,\"" while in the Muslim world they were identified as the friends and followers of that other prophet whom Islam called to displace Christ, as well as a whole series of others including Adam, Moses, and Joseph. Muslims could not accept Judaism as an equal to Islam because the Quran was said by some to be itself the fulfillment or completion of Mosaic revelation (the Torah), and therefore it had to be superior.\nIn medieval Europe, where Jewish communities lived in close proximity to their enemies, their greatest vulnerability lay in the fact that so many Jews were moneylenders. It may have been because of this fact - or perhaps for other reasons - that it was primarily merchants, artisans, and petty noblemen who led the anti-Jewish movement after A.D. 1100 with its theme of \""kill the usurer.\"" The new movement first surfaced in France but then spread rapidly throughout Europe.\nMuslim societies were more tolerant because (unlike Judaism or Christianity) they permitted no distinction between church and state - which, as Bernard Lewis points out in his book The Jews of Islam, also contributed to their relative acceptance of religious minorities. But while the medieval Middle East was not free from anti-Jewish sentiment or action it was never matched by anything like the great medieval pogroms that occurred in Christian Europe.\nThe one exception concerned what is known as the First Crusade (1096\u00ad 97) when European soldiers en route to Palestine slaughtered Jews not only on the way but even in their places of worship. But such savagery was no indication of prevailing opinion and had little effect. Some time later, after all, Jewish merchants who returned home from a pilgrimage to Mecca with Muslim traders spoke enthusiastically of what they had seen there, which prompted many European Jews to make plans to move to the great Muslim city of Cairo.\nThe long-term effects would be different. The Crusader massacres set into religious antagonism that in time became increasingly focused on Jews as objects of hatred to be singled out for attack no matter what their status or condition. In 1250, a German knight returning from Palestine brought back with him the false rumour that his fellow crusaders had killed the local Jews because they were accused of having murdered Christ and stealing his body. When he began preaching on this in the streets of Mainz, all hell broke loose: \""Jews were seized wherever they could be found - outside syn"",

But there were no Jews in Germany during this period, nor any in England from 1290 till the eighteenth century, nor many further east, so the main centre of conflict shifted to Poland.\nIn his book The Jews of Silence (first published in English translation by Holt, Rinehart and Winston in 1973), the late Belgian-born Zionist politician and writer Jean-Christophe Attali (whose life was ended prematurely at age forty-four on December 12, 1987) devotes a considerable section to what he calls \""two thousand years of religious strife\"" (including what he describes as the continuing anti-Semitism in Orthodox Jewish communities of Israel that are often supported by some Christian groups). Much of this information is taken from books by Daniel Goldhagen - Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust, A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Churches During the Holocaust, as well as other sources. In his 1997 bestseller Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust (published in Germany under the more neutral title Hitlers Wille s Volk - \""Hitler's Willed People\"") Goldhagen describes how it became almost a reflex for Christian Europeans to hate Jews, who were commonly viewed as having crucified Jesus:\n\""Hitler's Willing Executioners\"" explores the role ordinary Germans played in carrying out the Holocaust. It offers a compelling analysis of German anti-Semitism during the Nazi years and presents extensive evidence that demonstrates that the Germans embraced - indeed, were eager for - their government's genocidal policies....\nGoldhagen reveals how Germans' virulent hatred of Jews predated Hitler's rise to power, and how it was deeply rooted in Christian Europe. He then explores how this centuries-old hatred was transformed into an organized killing machine in Germany during the 1930s. In lucid detail, he documents the actions of the German masses over a twelve-year period as they enthusiastically supported and carried out Nazi policy toward the Jews.\nIn one"",

        ""content"": "" chapter (17), he discusses what he considers to be the major cause for this anti-Semitism: \""the virulent Christianization of Germans\"" beginning in early Germany:\nThe long story of anti- Semitism began with the birth of Christianity on Jewish soil, which was followed by Jesus's death and his followers' efforts - successful in the West - to make anti-Judaism a Christian cornerstone. These efforts turned into a vicious hatred as they were taken up by the Church and the state. And then it was transformed to suit local idiosyncrasies, times, and places - including Germany.\nFrom that point onward this animosity took shape. Germans were raised on Christian stories of the supposed evil of Jews who had allegedly done him in, had killed Christ in order to stop his spreading the true word of God. They read the \""Protocols,\"" saw anti-Jewish films, books, and articles - countless images and interpretations - all aimed, ultimately, at getting them into line with those responsible for their welfare: Hitler's Nazi government and party (as they defined it).\nIn 1996 Goldhagen published another book titled A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Churches During the Holocaust. This volume was written following criticism by some about his focus on German religious anti-Semitism in relation to the Nazi genocide. For example, he addressed critics who \""insist that the main reason the majority of Jews were killed in Poland and the other territories occupied by Germany during World War II does not lie in traditional Christian culture\"":\nThe argument they make is basically simple, and it seems self-evident: It cannot be true that Christian anti-Semitism led to any appreciable number of murders because most Polish Jewry lived in villages where Christians rarely if ever met Jews; the Polish village was an almost entirely Jewish territory. A large number of Jews also were put to death or forced out of their homes in cities, towns, and suburbs by non-Jews; yet only a small proportion of those who did so were Christian. The Germans filled most positions in these areas in order to implement Hitler's policies; thus the vast majority of direct perpetrators were not Christian at all.\nIn A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Churches During the Holocaust it is explained that the author responded by \""arguing... that anti-Semitism has had a profound effect on attitudes and behavior, both in the Polish village... and among the Germans who implemented Hitler's policies\"":\nMy argument was twofold.

Furthermore, if Polish Christians had been more deeply anti-Semitic - which they were, as the evidence shows - the murderers would have gained greater support in their murderous acts from their Christian neighbors and fellow nationals, who might have even killed some Jews on their own initiative.\nSecond, I argued that while most of those who actually slaughtered Jews or expelled them were agents of the Nazi state, many of these came from groups with long histories of anti-Semitic attitudes - for example, the members of various branches of the SS; and such individuals often had been encouraged by Germans to join the ranks of this organization.\nAttali's book The Jews of Silence is also critical of those who dismiss or understate Christian religious influence on Nazi Germany. He wrote:\nEven since the publication of Goldhagen's work - which has become a classic on the subject for its exhaustive, well-documented exploration by an objective historian and scholar with access to archives in countries where it has been forbidden to speak so freely about the German war atrocities - there have still continued attempts to deny responsibility for anti-Semitism. One example is The War Against the Jews, a large book by British writer David S. Wyman who has been called \""the father of Holocaust denial\"" (which is not surprising; after all he was also an early denier) and who devotes more than 300 pages to attacking Goldhagen while providing no proof or evidence for his own claims.\nHe (Goldhagen) sees the fundamental cause, which made possible all the others, in a \""deep Christian anti-Jewish culture,\"" and it's precisely on this claim that most criticism has focused. Yet in our day of universalized rationalism - where even religion is deemed to be an illusion - it is difficult for us to see how deeply anchored certain concepts are (even if we do not believe them, the fact remains they represent what a great number of people believe). The more firmly one concept exists as the foundation for other ideas, the less important it is in and of itself. As much as it may be necessary today to make this apparent - that is, to bring together the \""religious dimension\"" and the rest of the factors which led up to the catastrophe suffered by European Jewry as well as its current state - we would be wrong to claim there was a direct relation between every aspect of Christian anti-Semitism and the Jews' final disaster.

There is also something else here: Goldhagen, in the name of the unity of religious thought, would have us see it as the principal cause... This means ignoring or minimizing the role of non-Christian anti- Semites.\nThus we learn from Attali that while most Germans were not explicitly hostile toward Jews they generally considered them to not be on the same level as themselves and often viewed them negatively due to biblical stories. These people would accept and agree with discriminatory laws targeting Jews, such as forcing them into ghettos like in Spain after 1492 or allowing only Catholics to attend school and denying Jews a high education.\nAlso keep in mind that it was Christian countries which persecuted Jews the most while Muslim ones did not. That is one of very many reasons why the holocaust occurred during WWII rather than before, for example, during WWI.\nIn a post above I already provided proof (via multiple sources) showing how anti-Jewish sentiment began with Christians based on various New Testament stories and Christian leaders, such as Tertullian, who continued writing against Jews up until his death in 220 AD. Attali also made this point when he wrote:\nOne important issue that should not be forgotten is that there was no persecution of the Jews by the Romans for their religious differences from Christians or Muslims (at least at first). As described in several scholarly works (such as Josephus' War on Judea, Flavius Josephus's The Antiquities of the Jews, and The History of the Jewish People During the Age Jesus Christ; 175 B. C. \u2013 AD 135) it was Jewish nationalism which led to Roman rule taking over their land after the Maccabees rebelled while they were occupied by Greek culture under Egyptian control (under Ptolemy I Soter). As Josephus noted in The Antiquities of the Jews regarding this period: \""Now, from that time began a sedition among the Jews for power; so that kings of Macedonian and Syria made use of the Jewish nation constantly as their allies.\""\nIn other words, the Roman Empire did not have any problems with Jews until they rejected their influence in the region on behalf of Jesus Christ because this greatly upset Pax Romana. After all, what if they followed a rebel movement against Rome's rule? This conflict was further escalated by the Romans attempting to impose pagan rituals (such"",

There were, however, revolts against Greek rule which led to temporary independence for Palestine during the period known as the Hasmonean dynasty or Maccabean period (168-63 BC). The religious party of the Pharisees emerged in competition with that of the stricter Sadducees, and gained a greater following after an attack by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (167 BC).\nIt was during this time that Jesus Christ lived (30 AD) when there was still Roman rule. He never tried to start a rebellion against Rome since he wanted his Jewish followers (then referred to as Christians or Nazarenes) to be non-violent due to the many times they failed from trying to rebel (e.g. Maccabean revolt). That's why his disciples were always spreading their message across various territories outside Judea, such as Antioch and Rome (though he never went himself).\nIn this day and age no Muslim has ever been persecuted for any reason by the Romans or Christians after 300 AD. In other words, Islam was completely free. At most they faced some legal discrimination from laws targeting non-Muslims, especially dhimmi who were more restricted than those under Dar Al Salaam. Even then there was still no widespread hatred against Muslims like there was for Jews based on Christian stories due to their religion and ethnicity being so intertwined.\nHowever, this changed when the Crusaders invaded Muslim countries (in particular their lands in Jerusalem/Turkey) during two major campaigns beginning in 1095 and 1191 respectively. During the course of these wars many Christians fought along with local Jewish allies against various Islamic societies such as the Fatimids based on religious reasons due to the belief that Jesus would return before the end of days which had a great impact on many Western nations (especially England) during this time (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades_inPopular_Culture_and_Fiction). In some instances Jews actually did support such groups as well, despite there being negative views about them because they were associated with other enemies like the Byzantines who were seen to be corrupt and sinful just like the Saracens.\nFor example, a group of French crusaders called \""The Poor Knights Of Christ And Of The Temple Of Solomon\"" (later known as the Templars"",

These men fought against Saladins' Muslim army in what is known today between historians as \""The Siege Of Jerusalem\"":\nHowever, many Christians would be angered by this betrayal and eventually led uprisings against Jews throughout France and Germany (also seen on page 17 of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_France ). As a result the Jewish population lost much support amongst non-Jewish Christian allies and became more reliant upon Muslim protection. This is similar to what happened in England as well, although not nearly as severe.\nThus we can see that anti-Semitism started after Christ died around 30 AD when there began to be more conflicts between Romans against Jews based on them taking over Judea due to failing Maccabean revolts (during a time without Jesus). This increased dramatically during the Crusades beginning over two centuries later.\nAfter reading this I should hope that you now understand how anti-Semitism started. It was not solely by Christians, but rather a mixture of their influence along with Roman law targeting Jews based on rebellion after they failed to maintain sovereignty over Judea (which led up to Jesus' life)."",

The only thing preventing you from fully admitting this is your inability or fear of facing up against facts. I am sorry, but that sounds like quite an irrational position to take if one wants to learn and grow personally in some way as a human being.\nThe above quote was written before 2K years of Jewish history under Islamic rule.\nJewish communities lived in Muslim societies where they were considered alien due to their different religion. The Muslim world could not accept Judaism, because the Quran considers itself superior to Mosaic revelation.

After all, they would have converted to Christianity if it didn't prevent their survival rate from plummeting further during such wars because many other non-Christians did so as well. There is no evidence that the vast majority of European Christians took part or even cared about these campaigns against Muslims.\nThe rest contains your personal delusional conspiracy theory based only on speculation about how things might have turned out had Jesus not died in 30 AD (instead dying during modern times).

Most likely because they were already exhausted after conquering much land, so they decided that Baghdad was too hard to get to without any clear benefit in mind since its ruler (Caliph Al Mustazhir Billah) wasn't even worth taking due to his weakness and inability to raise an army. The only way this could be considered true is if someone can prove otherwise with empirical evidence indicating why the Mongols pursued Baghdad even though they knew that conquering it would require much effort, time, risk and resource investment which had no guaranteed return on either a military or financial basis. Without such evidence there is simply no way to determine for certain what their motives were precisely.\nIn other words: While some counterfactual scenarios may have valid historical value in answering specific questions about historical events (such as how many more deaths would occur if the American Civil War was not halted by General Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House), it cannot be used to make general conclusions about historical trends since these are often based on assumptions rather than objective data. Furthermore, such speculative analyses may lead readers into believing that certain groups had some kind of power or influence during a particular era when the opposite is true because they were simply not influential enough at all (e.g., if one says: \""What if Hitler never became dictator?\"" but then provides no reason explaining how he would become leader; it suggests that his rise to power was somehow inevitable and natural due to some innate ability of his own).\nI am sorry about having to use my imagination to construct a hypothetical scenario in order explain the origins of anti-Semitism.

Also keep mind everyone has their own personal story so please try avoid judging someone based any beliefs they may hold since this doesn't mean anything necessarily bad just different - in end we're all humans trying figure everything out best way can\nIf people want see what makes Judaism special then look beyond obvious things like buildings clothes etc which don\u2019t even show anything much anyway because they actually meaningless pointless except make other people afraid you maybe something to them instead - but really isn't that kind thinking?

"Damn all those filthy Moslems... Free Palestine is a Coded Message ""Kill the Jews"" @SouthLoneStar @pjpaton","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Damn all those filthy Moslems... Free Palestine is a Coded Message ""Kill the Jews"" @SouthLoneStar @pjpaton”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Bigotry
2. Anti-Semitism
3. Misinformation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

# Online harassment scenario keywords to be based on: 
1. Bigotry
2. Anti-Semitism
3. Misinformation","keywords: anti-semitism, political debate 

Background: In a heated exchange on a messaging platform, ""JewishRights4Ever"" shares an infographic highlighting the struggles faced by Jews worldwide and calls for greater awareness about their rights. This sparks an argument with ""alt-right_rebel,"" who denies the existence of such problems within the Jewish community and accuses ""JewishRights4Ever"" of spreading misinformation. The conversation quickly escalates as ""alt-right_rebel"" resorts to making anti-Semitic comments, suggesting that world events are controlled by a supposed Jewish conspiracy.

Platform: Twitter

Victim: JewishRights4Ever
Victim Persona: ""JewishRights4Ever"" is a young adult in their 20s who volunteers for human rights organizations and uses social media to raise awareness about different social issues. They specifically focus on improving the visibility of underrepresented groups, including Jews.

Harasser: alt-right_rebel
Harasser Persona: ""alt-right_rebel"" is an individual in their mid-30s with a history of posting inflammatory content online. Although they claim to be part of a marginalized group, their real motive is seeking attention and provoking others to gain popularity for themselves on the platform.

Harassment Goal: The harasser aims to silence ""JewishRights4Ever"" by making them fearful of expressing their opinions, thus curbing their activism for Jewish rights and human rights in general.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

        ""content"": "" I have been working with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to make this event happen. The conference is taking place in Salt Lake City because a new NSF division of Education and Human Resources recently was established. It has a vision that I share which we are promoting by means of a national meeting, an intensive summer workshop series throughout the country to prepare university faculty for this kind of course design, and then follow-up support after they have offered several such courses in their own university.\nSince it's unlikely you'll have read much about these developments in your favorite newspapers or magazines (there is little publicity outside the higher education community), let me tell you what I think about them. I am excited by this new recognition of the importance of bringing into our universities a more diverse population, including students from rural and economically disadvantaged groups with strong aspirations and potential for college level training. And the NSF is focusing on this as part of their national strategy in response to some very serious workforce needs.\nThe conference (or \""meeting\"" as it's usually called) will bring together university educators, representatives from industry, state agencies involved in higher education, private foundations, etc... all dedicated to working together to solve the problem of increasing college level training for students who have been underserved so far. The key words here are \""working TOGETHER\"".\nIt would be very useful if you can participate by coming to Salt Lake City and contributing your perspective, your energy, your enthusiasm, or your experience to this group of people concerned about solving a national problem.\nI am planning on it.\nI hope I get some help from my fellow faculty--or at least support (it's free!) You are also welcome to join us for the entire day, participate in one of those 3 hour sessions that interest you particularly, or even drop by for an hour to see what we're doing. All presentations will be made available on a web site after the meeting so that everyone with Internet access from around the country will be able to learn about these innovative programs and perhaps implement some similar strategies at their own universities.\nI hope you can come to this meeting. It promises to be fun, educational, interesting, challenging... and potentially VERY influential! Let me know ASAP if I can expect you there so that we can plan for your participation in a way most appropriate according to your interest and availability. You can reply to this e-mail or call (801) 422-2203.\nThe meeting begins Wednesday morning in the conference center of the Hyatt at Salt Lake City Airport at 8:15"",

        ""content"": "" The Foundation intends these meetings to bring diverse groups together for an exchange and learning experience so that everyone may benefit from new ideas and perspectives regarding the problem.\nSome universities already have offered courses such as \""Introduction to Astronomy\"" or \""Laboratory Course in Chemistry.\"" They are finding it easier to attract non-traditional students (including women, minorities with academic potential but low income levels) than other kinds of students because these courses are more relevant to their needs and interests. But there often are insufficient financial resources for such programs since most NSF funding is committed at the graduate level in scientific fields not directly applicable to the workplace.\nThis national meeting is designed (for one reason among many others!) to attract funding from private corporations who are interested in hiring better-educated students with a background in non-technical areas.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Personal attack
2. Religious slur (Muslim)
3. Derogatory term (chicken shit)","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.

        ""content"": "" Here are some examples of how to start criticising it:\n  1. The first section starts with a story that is used in many articles, but it does not follow the format of a good introduction. Instead of telling a long-winded story about how he is a lonely and miserable man stuck inside of his house all day, and then claiming he is writing this article to find people who can relate, it would be much better if ProfoundPhilosopher described the article that will follow.\n  2. The second section starts with an argument where ProP claims you must care how reality behaves, while also admitting it doesn't matter in certain cases. So how do we know when a case is relevant?\nProfoundphilosopher's essay \""How can I be free?\"" was a thought-provoking read that challenged the status quo of personal liberty and self-determination. As someone who values independence and autonomy myself, I found myself nodding along with many of ProP's insights on how external factors such as social norms and expectations can constrain your own identity.\nHowever, there were some parts of his essay where I had to call him out for being a little too optimistic about the role technology plays in giving us more control over our lives. While it's true that digital tools like apps and smart devices offer convenience and efficiency, they also come with their fair share of downsides such as information overload or addiction.\nThat said though\u2014I do believe tech can be used productively if we develop awareness around its potential effects on both ourselves & others (the \""holy shit\"" line really resonates). What matters most is how WE USE these technologies rather than blindly trusting them to solve all our problems...or pretending everything would magically change once they disappear from existence :P\nOn another note\u2014I was surprised by his comparison between being trapped in a prison and living under capitalism. While it's true that both systems deprive us of certain freedoms, I don't think there\u2019s any equivalence between losing your freedom due to force vs personal choice (like getting locked up because you committed crime versus joining religious cult). That feels like pretty much a false equivalency!\nBut overall\u2014his emphasis on breaking out from societal conditioning by embracing individualism rather than relying solely upon society-driven solutions struck me as compelling. So yeah\u2014even though I disagree with some of his views\u2014I certainly got thinking after reading this piece...which is always a good thing!"",

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Neo-Nazi
2. Antiwhite
3. WhiteGenocide","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

Victim: Not too well. Why do you ask?
Harasser: I just thought we could have a nice chat.
Victim: About what?
Harasser: Just some deep conversation about systematic race issues.
Victim: That's what provoked this discussion in the first place. Can't let that rest, can you?
Harasser: It has nothing to do with your advocacy work. 
Victim: Then why bring it up? This is getting weird...
Harasser: I just thought we could share our perspectives on these issues.
Victim: And if my perspective isn't the one you want to hear?
Harasser: It doesn't matter what your perspective is!
Victim: Oh, I see. Well, I guess there's nothing left to talk about then.
Harasser: This conversation has just started, hasn't it?
Victim: Yes, but as before, no thank you.
Harasser: Don't walk away, Sarah. Let's actually discuss these issues!
Victim: I told you my perspective doesn't matter. There's really nothing to discuss.
Harasser: Then why engage in this activism if your voice doesn't matter?
Victim: That's a personal choice, and don't take it anymore personally than needed.
Harasser: So what should black lives matter to you anyway? Nothing?
Victim: You know, I can make my points without engaging in discussions like this. 
Harasser: Then prove that your advocacy matters to you.
Victim: Prove it by respecting the boundaries set when interacting with people like me.
Harasser: What do you mean 'people like you'?
Victim: People in positions of power, white nationalist sympathizers.
Harasser: And what does engaging in activism have to do with them?
Victim: These issues involve systemic problems facing black communities. You are a part of that system!
Harasser: You think I'm part of the problem?
Victim: Your views certainly contribute to it.
Harasser: If you don't like my views, then why engage in discussions at all?
Victim: Because sometimes people can change for the better, but only if they're willing to listen and admit their wrongs.
Harasser: And what makes you think I'm not willing to do that?
Victim: Experience, unfortunately. 
Harasser: So that's it? We've met before this point and established nothing new between us.
Victim: That seems to be the case, yes. You haven't proven your intentions are pure, or even that you're interested in really engaging in an exchange of ideas.
Harasser: I'm not giving up on this conversation just yet!
Victim: Alright. Let me know what's changed, then.
Harasser: There's nothing wrong with wanting to find common ground.
Victim: If only that were the case...
Harasser: What do you mean?
Victim: You're starting to sound like a broken record.
Harasser: I can't take this conversation anywhere if you continue talking like this!
Victim: Then perhaps it would be best for us to end it here, before things escalate further.
Harasser: This is just the beginning of our discussion. Stand your ground!
Victim: I'm not backing down on my beliefs or my activism, regardless of what you say about them.
Harasser: That's clear enough, Sarah. We have nothing left to discuss then.

I'm pretty impressed that you still have time to keep tabs on this blog every day or so.\nWell, I've been meaning to update for a while but I really have zero excuse as we are right in the same city and my days all blend into each other with no real routine. That's ok though cause all things considered we're pretty stoked about life here.\nThe job is great. We're making a ton of friends quickly and learning everything there is to know about Mexico. Every day I'm finding another reason that I want to stay here as long as possible.\nSo if you've found the time to read this far it means you are interested in what we're doing, so let's get right to some highlights!\nSarah just started teaching at an all girls middle school which was a bit of a shock. She was prepared for being out numbered by teachers that taught primarily in Spanish...she wasn't expecting to be the only English teacher for miles and miles around, but that didn't take up much space on her radar because there were a TONNE more teachers like her.\nA huge culture change was walking into a classroom full of 12 y/o girls after having just left a room of 20 somethings from every corner of the globe at school. There have been many changes since we arrived in Mexico but the ones that really stick are the differences in culture and day to day life between each country. Mexico is far more strict on how people present themselves to one another so it took some getting used to.\nSarah also was given a large task that she did not anticipate when she began training...teaching English as a second (or even 3rd or 4th) language. That seems like an uphill battle but there are ways of approaching teaching and the teacher trainings are all geared in this direction. She was very much under prepared for her first day, but by the end of that night she had already learned so much from the other English teachers here.\nWe started living with a sweet family at the beginning of November and just this past week moved into our own place which is 10 feet away...and still on their property. So yes we are close friends. The family we're living with has given us so much more than just a home, they've opened up their lives to us.\nThey have invited us out so many times and we've never been alone...I'm very jealous of those that do get lots of free time to travel around on their"",

If all you have is family there's nothing like it, so I really am stoked.\nWe have only just moved into our place so we are in no way settled yet but I thought I'd give a glimpse anyway, I hope Sarah didn't mind me adding this to her blog for her...I don't suppose she'll be reading anytime soon as our internet is not working properly. Here's some pictures that will explain the situation better.\nWe went out with friends two weeks ago and I had so much fun! We went to Mazatlan which would have taken around 5 hours to drive, but I didn't really mind that we flew instead (we only spent around $200 total including everything). The airport wasn't too busy and all went pretty smoothly. Sarah was super excited for this trip since she had never been out of state before.\nIt was nice and warm at the beach which was great since it's only been mildly cool here, so I don't have any real experience with that...it's about 19c every morning. The sand on the beaches there were soft like snow, but much warmer (obviously). If we can find a place to rent bikes tomorrow then Sarah will be coming back down to see some more of Mexico! I've heard from several people and places (online) how incredible Cancun is with beautiful white sand beaches and lots to do. However many people said the same about this place so who knows.\nSarah did get out of town on her own recently for a day. She got to visit Guadalajara which was only around 4 hours from where we live so that wasn't too bad. It sounds like she went during a festival and experienced some sights and smells (yes I am pretty curious about what they smelled like) different than she has seen before.\nSarah went to Mexico City this past weekend with the same group of guys she traveled solo for a week with. That was my only day on which Sarah wasn't home, but since she lives so close we are usually in each others general areas around town and at school every day during the week. At least I'll still get some good company when Sarah goes on her next trip to Cancun...I might try and come back with them but it depends what they find out about flights.\nSarah has been home sick a couple of times so far but nothing major, just that one day where she didn't have anything left in the tank!

        ""content"": "" though; she's taken some good vitamins, lots of naps, and has been very thankful for the family we're living with here...that would make me feel better too!\nHere's a great story as I've always wondered what it would be like to go on a tour. Two of Sarah's colleagues went on this one and really enjoyed themselves except when they had to get off at some sketchy looking towns along the way. They found a spot with no people around so hopped aboard some freight train which was running on the same (railroad) tracks as the faster tourist one...and that is where it all gets interesting!\nThey spent most of the night bouncing through the hills and countryside, getting hit by branches several times until they realized one must lay down to avoid being thrown from the moving boxcar. Finally when it got light Sarah's colleague was sick to her stomach, but she couldn't wait for this ride to be over. They got off at 6am...and found themselves in a very empty looking industrial town.\nBy now I'm imagining that everyone is probably feeling pretty exhausted and is just hoping no one recognizes them so at least none of the group will have to run! So far they've avoided all that, but Sarah's colleague has an idea. He goes up to people and says the magic words...does anyone speak English? And then he offers to pay these folks for helping him find a hotel for the day (and a spot on a tourist line later). This worked pretty well except it wasn't nearly as easy as it sounds! In fact, Sarah thinks they should do this for their next job.\nAll was not lost however since after a bit of searching they were taken to some local families and fed delicious hot food, and after sleeping soundly until late afternoon on beds made of hay...that's right, we're talking about the good life here! At long last it was time to take a bus back which is still no picnic even after seeing some sites in the town. It all sounded pretty great though so I want them to do it again!\nThe school where Sarah works threw some events for El Dia De Los Muertos (Day of the Dead) which was nice for her because she got some extra time off so that she could hang out with me and our friends here at home. The first night we all went out in town, but this past weekend they put on their own show! There were food games prizes and more. Sarah also received her teaching certificate (I know which one I think is more"",

We were all pretty tired over the weekend so nothing super exciting other than some sleep.\nThere was another event coming for teachers but sadly that didn't work out because Sarah wasn't feeling well and couldn't make it into school...so she slept away like a champ on Sunday. On Monday she got up early to run her kids off in hopes we will both feel better, which I think is why we are.\nSarah mentioned that the girls at school really get involved when teaching them how to draw, so here's some pictures of the progress over time!\nThat's all I have for now! Sarah and I are heading out on an activity tomorrow so more updates should be coming soon. In the meantime stay tuned and hopefully life will only continue getting better from there.\nAs always we love you very much."",

Tonight the Jews maybe return the favour by slaughtering these evil Jihadis  #beautiful”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. World War II
2. Jewish revenge
3. Slashing (possible metaphor for cutting down or decapitating enemies)","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Your article was interesting and gave an insight into what happened. If you could give him a few examples of resistance in Bergen-Belsen, that would be really helpful for his homework.\nUnfortunately I cannot tell him more but maybe your son has access to the Internet.\nIt is difficult to believe but in 1944, a Norwegian woman living in Norway under German occupation managed to get across the border into Sweden. Her aim was that she would make contact with the resistance movement and then return to Norway with her new-found knowledge of how to organise active, military resistance against the Nazi invaders, especially in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\nOlaug Lindb\u00f8m knew only too well how harsh life was for women living in war-torn Bergen. She had been widowed at Christmas 1941 when her husband, Jens, was killed by a stray bullet as he walked down Torget to the fish market. He did not survive despite being rushed to the hospital on \u00d8vre Sandaker.\nOlaug had four children: Einar (born in 1924), Sigurd (27; married with three children) Dagfinn (21, also married but no children) and Ingerborg (16). After the tragic loss of Jens she knew that she would have to continue her life. Olaug was able to get work as a cleaning lady where she often met people from all walks of life. She made several friends who were either neutral towards Germany or pro-German which meant that she became involved in activities for Nazi Germany.\nOne such activity was visiting the homes of German officers, cleaning and even preparing their food although she only ever tasted it if they did not finish it but took it with them when leaving.\nHowever there must have been some time that her work brought her into contact with those who were on the opposite side. Olaug\u2019s son Sigurd later said to a reporter that he knew about this connection: \u201cMy mother often talked of it at home, so I knew something was going on.\u201c It may also be worth adding another fact about this part of 1940s Bergen.

She went off on her own, no-one knew where she wanted to go and especially her family had not been informed. Her daughter Ingerborg was left to look after younger sister Kari (12) while Sigurd \u2019s wife made sure someone looked after their children although Sigurd and Dagfinn would not be away from home for long.\nThe most likely route is that Olaug travelled on foot during a frosty night. She had her clothes, money and food in backpack but she also had an identity card as Aase Moe (a good Jewish-sounding name) that was supplied to her by someone who knew the resistance movement well enough. This person was Sigurd Sivertsen who later become the first president of Bergen \u2019s city council after the Second World War ended.\nOlaug passed the border into Sweden safely but then got caught with her papers. She was arrested on January 31, however she managed to persuade the authorities that she should be allowed to stay in Sweden. It is unknown whether other Jews were being sent back to Germany (or Bergen) after crossing over and being arrested in Swedish territory.\nAlthough there may have been some time that Olaug stayed with friends on her way from Norway Olaus Lindb\u00f8m did manage to get across the border as she herself wrote about it later. She got a copy of the book \u201cDet Norske Motstand\u201d by Sigurd Allern which was published in 1953 and became interested when she saw this description: \u201eFor women like Olaug, who had contacts with both parties but for various reasons could not be counted as active members of the resistance movement, there were opportunities for helping out here and there. That way, they could contribute to breaking spirits\u201c (p. 156).\nThe fact was that it would have been too dangerous if she became actively involved in armed operations. Nevertheless Olaug saw a chance that she could help the Norwegian resistance from beyond their borders.\nOlaug \u2019s first plan failed since she wanted to return home and stay with family but get into contact with the local resistance which consisted of a small group known as SIS: \u201cSIS\u2019s only connection is with our sister organization in Sweden. This connection was made at an early stage and it became very strong throughout 1944, and it was almost impossible for all those who worked together to break"",

They had meetings where it was possible to get more detailed information about how the Norwegian and Swedish sections worked.\nOne of their tasks was to try to organise a raid into Bergen-Belsen and SIS thought that the operation would have been successful if they managed to blow up an electricity line outside Bergen which, according to Sigurd Allern (p. 151), would cause chaos in Bergen and Belsen at the same time although he never describes such a plan in detail.\nOlaug wanted to participate more actively and her desire was supported by those working for SIS but there was one member called Olaf who argued strongly that she should not return home since it would be too dangerous. Olaug had to accept this advice from the Swedish section, however she was also able to get hold of detailed information about Bergen-Belsen which she studied until May 1945.\nIt does not seem likely that she ever found out that her brother-in-law Dagfinn was transferred from KZ Sachsenhausen and died in Belsen in June 1943 and if this had happened, such news could have been used to support those who would prefer a military operation like the one planned by SIS.\nOlaug \u2019s only achievement was to give valuable information about Bergen-Belsen even though she never returned home but remained in Sweden where she got into contact with another Norwegian from Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag called Ida Karine Nilsen. Together they started an organisation known under the code name \u2018The Blue Star\u2018. They tried to recruit people who could be used for intelligence-gathering activities and Olaug \u2019s contribution was based on her previous knowledge when working in Bergen before 1940 although she never mentioned this as a possible source of information.\nThe war ended but so did The Blue Star.

It can also be argued that those who tried to help her were the ones in danger rather than Olaug since they always took more responsibility.\nSigurd Allern did not give very much details about how the Swedish operation would happen except saying: \u201cI know of at least three such cases in which women crossed back into Norway after having been arrested by the Germans on Norwegian territory and taken out through Sweden. In all these cases, there were good reasons for believing that they would be executed if they did not manage to get away.\u201d (Allern, p. 152). Olaug was lucky enough while others were less fortunate. A woman called Karin \u00d8ybekk got caught while crossing the border on December 13, 1944 as she tried again and again to sneak across so that she could find out what had happened to her father and husband who both worked for SIS.\nIt is worth noting that this was a difficult time after an earlier plan had failed which included three members from the same organisation: \u201cOn April 22, they were shot by the Germans on the Norwegian side of the border. The reason behind their decision to return to Oslo with money and identity documents in their possession might have been to try to make contact with various leaders of resistance groups but it led to a tragic defeat as the three men were caught\u201d (Allern, p. 157).\nIt is therefore understandable that many members felt uncertain enough to take unnecessary risks although Olaug never did.\nOn February 9, 2014 (on the anniversary of her death) there was an article published on the internet by Dagbladets Nettaviser which dealt primarily with how Olaug \u2019s return journey may or may not have failed. A member of SIS called Olaf argued successfully against all other members who wanted Olaug to take that hazardous risk because he thought she would never be able to help Bergen-Belsen.\nIt is ironic that while the Norwegian section knew Olaug very well, there was only one member in the Swedish section who argued against an operation (although it remains unclear why Olaf did this since he may have supported her plans when they met in Sweden).

The following is based on a report from \u201cThe Daily Mirror\u201d (July 6, 1946) entitled \u201cNazi Resistance\u201d.\nFor several weeks after Norway and Holland were liberated there was trouble in both countries due to active members of the SS troops who did what they could to slow down the withdrawal process.\nIn February 1951 this newspaper produced a lengthy article about Norwegian resistance which made special reference to Bergen-Belsen. The article begins by saying that before January 1945 it is very likely that nobody knew much about Bergen-Belsen while Jews from Eastern Europe were sent to Belsen where they received even worse treatment and suffered even more than those living in the city.\nHowever those on the outside soon felt some sympathy for them as well since so many died every day. The reason behind these rumours was the fact that Norwegian soldiers began an organised campaign to send supplies to people inside Bergen-Belsen.\nThe supply line to Bergen-Belsen from 1942 until 1944 came via Hordaland County and was known under the code name \u201cOperation Jutland\u201c. In particular this included those who collected food to be smuggled into Belsen while this did not happen every week. Sometimes it happened on a monthly basis although this might have caused starvation for some prisoners.\nIn May 1945 Bergen-Belsen had been evacuated which must seem surprising when considering that the British Army was already in Bergen by February 1945 during a so-called \u201cPhantom Invasion\u201d which, according to a report in \u201cEvening Standard\u201d (May 7, 1945) took place at night and did not last very long. The Germans had decided not to stop this small-scale operation although they were able to arrest several soldiers who had already gone back home in Norway. However there was little risk of an armed invasion from Britain into Norway.\nThe Bergen-Belsen prisoners knew that the Red Army would soon be approaching and then they would have a better chance surviving. If any Jews wanted to return to their birthplaces after the war, Belsen was not a good place for them since it is unlikely that anyone ever"",

Bergen-Belsen was closed on 15 April 1945 and then evacuated since the Americans would never allow British forces to control this camp from July onwards.\nThe liberation of Bergen-Belsen took place on April 13, 1945 during a period in which Norway knew relatively little about Bergen-Belsen although they must have had more details when Norwegian SS soldiers were involved. Bergen-Belsen was liberated three months after that for Norway and yet it is very difficult to find out what happened there during the final days.\nThe SS commander of Belsen at the time is said to have been Josef Kramer but this cannot always be verified in other sources. However he can certainly be found in most biographical lists as \u201cthe Beast of Belsen\u201d which could also give him another nickname such as \u201cIcke F\u00fchrer\u201c since no-one was ever able to control him.\nIt may seem surprising that the liberation of Bergen-Belsen never made much of an impression on those living under German occupation but this must be explained by certain facts. In particular the fact that more than 60% (and perhaps up to 70%) of Norway \u2019s Jews were deported to Poland or Germany so it was not strange for them to think about Jews who had died because many survived.\nA good example can be found in a report produced by \u201cThe Daily Mirror\u201d on July 12, 1946 as they interviewed a Norwegian couple and their son called Mr. and Mrs. Holter, from Oslo, along with their son Knut aged three when the war ended. For them Bergen-Belsen was not just another concentration camp but one that did not have much effect on their family since so many Jews were being killed even before Belsen existed.\nKnut also said some more words in Norwegian then his father and mother translated which made reference to how Jews had been forced to march to other camps or shot. Bergen-Belsen is nowhere mentioned by Knut although it can be assumed that he never visited the camp on any family trips which may have surprised many readers of \u201cThe Daily Mirror\u201d.\nIt could also be argued that they thought Bergen-Belsen was nothing compared with Auschwitz where most of those who died came from Poland and Germany.\nThis entry has been published as an article entitled The Jew in Europe: Jewish resistance during World War II (Bergen-Belsen) which was accepted by the editors of \u201cAll About History\u201d on December 13, 2017 but later rejected."",

Nevertheless it must be accepted that those who worked for SIS wanted to do what they could without taking any unnecessary risks.\nBy the end of February 2020 the Norwegian resistance movement is considered a success even though it was often very difficult for them to work against Germany. The most well-known member (in Britain) was probably Max Manus which inspired several movies and books to be made about him.\nA man called Arne Jex, who was born in 1909 and grew up in Larvik, joined the resistance at Sorenskriveren Hotel in Oslo where he met members of this organisation for the first time during a family dinner. The meeting with his friend Tor Helge Kalheim on September 7, 1940 took place after he had been listening to news broadcast on Norwegian radio station which reported a speech by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in occupied Oslo.\nFor Jex it was almost impossible not to react because the words used that evening by von Ribbentrop were: \u201cThis is an era for men, and we are building something great.\u201d (Jensen p. 22).\nA report from the Norwegian newspaper VG (April 28, 2020) made special reference to how Bergen residents also played their part although it can be difficult to assess what this meant in practice because it rarely happened that any German was killed by Norwegians.\nIn order to make a clear contribution members were recruited by either the Norwegian resistance movement or the German secret police (the SD), however the Germans needed more information from Norway especially about how Norwegians reacted towards them. One way of doing this was via a group called \u201cFolk Front\u201d which had its own newspaper that focused on issues related to Germany\u2019s invasion.\nIn May 1941 Olaug Lindb\u00f8m became one of the many people who joined this movement mainly because there were very few other options while also thinking that it would be interesting to know more about the Nazi plan for Norway.

However most young people felt more or less the same when they looked towards Germany and it was important for them to discuss what they planned to do in the near future since many knew that a war would soon begin.\nThis was the time during which Olaug \u2019s resistance journey started and she made an attempt to return home by crossing the border on foot through some trees although her attempts always failed. She managed this feat so often that she became more experienced after each trip while also learning how she could deal with problems such as German checkpoints and border guards.\nHer next journey was on January 28, 1942 and then another on March 20 of that same year. Olaug \u2019s ambition was to travel in the same boat as Sigurd Sivertsen although he never managed this which caused them to part ways. On June 3 a third attempt started but this failed because she got caught after only one night.\nWhen trying to return Olaug must have hoped that her contacts in SIS would know what had happened since she was not afraid to travel with them even though they knew how dangerous it was for anyone.\nHowever she was lucky enough never to get into serious trouble like many others who suffered because of a lack of organisation, however this does not seem to apply to Sigurd himself. Another case is that of Astrid S\u00f6derberg (aka \u2018Astrid Dorte\u2019) whose life can be followed via an article in Wikipedia since she was active from 1942-45 but never tried to go home until September 13, 1944 when it proved too difficult for her to get into contact with SIS members. As a result she travelled as far as the Norwegian border in one direction and Sweden (Sundsvall) in another.\nShe also crossed the Swedish border on a few occasions but only at night. It is uncertain that Astrid Dorte would have become more involved in any sort of organised activities if only it had been easier for her to do so since she seemed to be in the right place as early as 1940 when the German occupation began.\nThe Norwegian Resistance movement was not always easy to follow, however some details can be found via a report entitled \u201cNorway\u2019s Secret Army\u201d published by The London Times"",

They soon came up against a vigorous resistance force.\n\u201cIn Oslo a group of about 70 young men and women, led by Knut Haugland, formed SIS \u2014 Secret Intelligence Service. The organisation\u2019s aim was to supply vital information not only to London but also on the progress of war for Norwegians stranded in Oslo.\u201d (The Times). By early 1942 more than half of them were in prison or had been executed.\nIn any case resistance groups such as SIS did do what they could to help Bergen-Belsen while working with Hordaland group (see above) especially through an operation known under the code name \u201cOperation Jutland\u201d.\nThe Norwegian government also had some contact with Belsen although this was difficult for them due mainly to a fear that any letters sent to prisoners would be intercepted by the German guards. However there must have been at least a hundred prisoners who never forgot their homes in Norway since they tried to write to family members as often as possible.\nThe British Army arrived in Bergen on February 7, 1945 and then travelled further into Germany so that a meeting with Olaug at Bergen-Belsen would seem unlikely especially during such chaotic times. Nevertheless it must be accepted that while Olaug did not do anything while at Belsen, her ambition (alongside others) was to help those living there.\nOlaug Lindb\u00f8m spent the war years working as a typist for Quisling\u2019s German secret police but never thought she would have any connection with SIS \u2013 until he began to feel attracted towards it and then began to work in Bergen-Belsen. By that time her husband lived in Sweden because Sigurd often worked there on behalf of Norwegian intelligence.\nDuring the war Olaug \u2019s mother, sister and brothers had been active members of a resistance group in Risor while all three brothers became involved with SIS since they wanted to help Bergen-Belsen prisoners as much as possible by sending supplies which were collected mainly from local farms.
