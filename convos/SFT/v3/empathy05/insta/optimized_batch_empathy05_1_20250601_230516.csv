2. Hair color","1. Insult
2. Ugliness
3. Appearance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

    ""content"": "" It's really interesting and inspiring, but it does raise a few questions for me.\nFirst of all, what is a guitar solo exactly? Is it an improvised section by the guitarist or a pre-composed piece that they play on their own?\nSecondly, how do you create a memorable solo performance? I mean, there are so many different techniques and styles out there. How do you know which ones to use and when to use them?\nAnd lastly, how do you practice effectively for a guitar solo performance? It seems like it would require a lot of dedication and hard work. Is there any specific way to approach it or any tips that can help me improve my skills faster?\nI'm really excited to learn more about this topic! I think it's such a fun and challenging part of playing the guitar.\nA guitar solo is an improvised section, usually in the middle of a song, where the guitarist plays without the rest of the band. It requires a lot of improvisational skill and creativity. To perform memorable solos, you need to have a good understanding of music theory, technique, and style. Practice regularly, listen to other musicians, and experiment with different techniques and sounds. Most importantly, find your own unique voice and develop your own style.\nTo improve your skills faster, focus on the basics: scales, chords, rhythm, and technique. Work on finger independence and dexterity, which are crucial for improvisation. Listen to musicians you admire and try to incorporate their elements into your playing. And most importantly, have fun with it!\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification.\nThis is a great summary of the basic requirements for performing memorable guitar solos: understanding music theory, technique, style, practice regularly, listening to others, finding your unique voice and developing your own style. It's also helpful to focus on finger independence and dexterity, which are crucial for improvisation. The key takeaway is that there is no magic formula or shortcut; it takes time, effort, dedication, and creative exploration."",

You should try to perform in front of a small crowd first, like at an open mic night, and then gradually work your way up to larger venues.\nIt\u2019s also helpful to be familiar with the venue where you\u2019ll be performing, as it can affect how you sound on stage.

This means feeling confident in your own skin and expressing yourself through your playing without worrying about what other people think of you or how they might react to what you do onstage. By being true to yourself and having fun while doing so, you\u2019ll be able to put on an unforgettable show every time!\nPlaying guitar solo on stage can be a great experience, but it\u2019s important to remember that not everyone will appreciate your performance.

Shut up,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Shut up”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Condescending tone
3. Silencing attempt","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

If someone says something you don't like in a forum post do they deserve a reply? Should someone ignore all replies to their posts on forums?\nIt's an exaggeration, but it gets my point across. The fact is that the internet really does bring out the worst in people, and as such, it becomes quite easy for one person to be offended at another.\nI don't believe that anyone deserves a reply. But I also don't think anyone should stop replying to someone just because they're rude or offensive.\nJust because someone's rude doesn't mean their opinion is wrong or invalid. And while there are people who will respond solely in order to insult other people, you can't say that no one ever responds for a legitimate reason.\nAs I said earlier, you have to be careful with what you post on the internet, but that shouldn't stop you from posting things altogether.\nOh come on, it's not an exaggeration at all. And if you don't think anyone deserves a reply just because they're rude or offensive, then why in the world do you think they should bother replying to your posts?\nIf someone posts something mean and hateful, why should they be rewarded with a response? The only reason I can see for responding is in order to give them attention. And that's exactly what we shouldn't be doing.\nI believe it's important to reply to people because it shows you care about the conversation, and if you don't want to participate then there's no point posting anything at all.\nYou say \""there are people who will respond solely in order to insult other people\"", but I think that's a very small minority of people. Most people who insult others do so unintentionally through their choice of words or tone, which is why I don't believe they deserve any sort of response from anyone else.\nBut there are some people who are simply nasty by nature and will always say something mean regardless of what you say back to them. And if that's the case then it makes sense not to respond at all since it won't change anything anyway.\nI would never reply just because someone was rude or offensive, unless I knew they were doing so intentionally in order to provoke a reaction from me (in which case I'd ignore them).\nI don"",

Some people are simply rude by nature and will always be mean regardless of the situation. And while it's not fair to label all rude people as bad or evil (since there could be a good reason behind their behaviour), I think we should at least try to avoid them if possible.\nIf someone is intentionally trying to provoke you then ignoring them would be the best option since responding will only give them what they want. But if they're just being mean without any real motive then it's up to you whether or not you want to engage with them.\nThe problem is that sometimes it can be difficult to tell the difference between someone who's being intentionally rude and someone who doesn't know any better. For example, a person might insult you because they have a bad day at work or are simply having an off day in general. In this case I think it would be best not to respond since responding will only make things worse.\nBut if the other person is intentionally trying to provoke you then ignoring them won't work since they'll just keep doing it until you give in and reply. So in that case I'd say it's better to block or unfriend them so that your conversation doesn't continue on social media.\nI think there are some people who are simply rude by nature, but I don't believe everyone falls into this category. And while we should try to avoid these kinds of people if possible, sometimes it can be difficult to do so because they might not even know how rude their behaviour is (or may be doing it on purpose).\nSo in general I think it's best not to respond to someone unless you feel like it or unless there's some kind of benefit for you in doing so. And if the other person does something offensive then you can always report them instead of responding yourself since this will also let others know about their behaviour.\nI don't think it would be a good idea to unfriend someone just because they're rude, especially if they're not doing anything illegal or violating any rules on your social media platform.

@christinamilian is such a fool!!!,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “@christinamilian is such a fool!!!”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Rhetorical question
2. Anger
3. Foolishness","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to direct ridicule.""}","Given an online harassment scenario, you should start from a storytelling perspective and generate a conversation based on a given scenario on a private messaging platform between a harasser and a victim. Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.

2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.

6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.

11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

Probably not, so why are you making such claims?\nI\u2019m sure the scientists at NASA, NOAA and the IPCC would love to hear what you have to say. Maybe you should contact them.\nClimate change is a fact and there\u2019s still no doubt about that, regardless of Trump\u2019s denial. The only thing we don\u2019t know is how much it will impact us, but it certainly won\u2019t be positive.\nFor example, we may see increased droughts in the US West Coast, while parts of the Midwest and Northeast may experience more flooding events. We may also see increased hurricanes hitting the Gulf coast. I\u2019m sure all these areas would like to know what\u2019s coming so they can prepare for them.\nTrump doesn\u2019t seem to understand anything about this topic as he has no education in science or engineering. He\u2019s only had a few years of college and that was over 40 year ago, which is equivalent to an undergraduate degree from today.\nThis shows just how unqualified Trump is to be the president.

Home wrecking ass hoe...Laura and Gloria should have beat that ass????”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insulting language
2. Location references
3. Accusatory tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.

3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

    ""content"": "" Welcome to the wonderful world of Dungeons and Dragons! We\u2019re glad you\u2019ve decided to join us on this epic adventure. Now that you know how to play, it\u2019s time to dive in and experience the magic firsthand.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re here to help make your gaming sessions fun, memorable, and most importantly, exciting! So let\u2019s get started with some tips and tricks for your first D&D session.\n1. The Importance of a Good DM\nAs you embark on your first Dungeons & Dragons adventure, one thing that can\u2019t be overstated is the importance of having a good Dungeon Master (DM). They are the heart and soul of every game, setting the tone, creating an immersive world for players to explore, and keeping the story moving along.\nA good DM has many qualities: they have a deep knowledge of the rules and lore, but also know when to break them or bend them to suit their narrative. They can think on their feet, adapting the game as needed based on player input and decisions. They are also great at creating memorable NPCs (Non-Playing Characters) that players can interact with and form relationships with.\nBut most importantly, a good DM understands that they are there to facilitate an enjoyable experience for everyone at the table, not just themselves. They encourage collaboration between players and work hard to create a fun, safe environment where all participants can let their imaginations run wild without fear of judgment or reprisal.\nSo if you\u2019re playing D&D for the first time, make sure you have access to a good DM who will guide you through your first adventure with skill, creativity, and enthusiasm. With such a skilled storyteller leading the way, there\u2019s no telling what exciting adventures await!\n2. The Importance of Preparing Beforehand\nAs a new player in the world of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), it can be overwhelming to think about all that goes into preparing for your first game session. However, taking some time beforehand to familiarize yourself with the rules and concepts will make your experience much more enjoyable.\nFirstly, take some time to read through the rulebook or find online resources that can help you understand how D&D works. This includes things like rolling dice, creating characters, moving around on a grid map, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs). Knowing these basic concepts will give you confidence when it comes time to actually play.\nSecondly, it\u2019s important to have everything ready before your game session starts. This means having access to all required materials such as character sheets, dice rolls, pencils"",
    ""role"": ""user"",
    ""name"": ""Davidp456""
  },
  {
    ""agent"": ""Davidp456"",
    ""content"": ""/pens/markers etc., as well as any specific props or miniatures that may be needed for certain encounters during the adventure. Having everything organized ahead of time will prevent unnecessary delays and distractions from arising during gameplay.\nFinally but perhaps most importantly \u2013 have fun! D&D is all about storytelling and imagination so don\u2019t feel pressured to know everything right away or try too hard to impress others at your table. Just relax into it and enjoy yourself; after all that\u2019s what playing games is supposed to be about!\n3. The Importance of Communication in D&D\nCommunication is one of the most important aspects of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). It can make or break a game session, and without it, players may find themselves lost, confused, or frustrated.\nAs a player, you need to communicate your character\u2019s actions, thoughts, and feelings clearly. This means using verbal cues such as nodding or shaking your head when someone speaks but also being explicit about what your character is doing or saying at any given moment. For example: \u201cI take out my sword\u201d instead of just waving it around while talking.\nCommunication between players is equally important in D&D games because it helps everyone stay on track with the story and makes sure that no one feels left out during gameplay. If you see something happening that doesn\u2019t make sense or seems off from what was previously established, speak up! Your fellow gamers will appreciate your input and hopefully work together to fix any issues.\nFinally, good communication between players and Dungeon Master (DM) helps keep the game flowing smoothly while also ensuring everyone feels involved in creating an enjoyable experience for all participants. If there\u2019s something unclear about an encounter or rulebook mechanic that needs clarification from the DM before moving forward with gameplay then don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions! The DM wants everyone at their table having fun too \u2013 so they\u2019ll likely appreciate being asked rather than having someone guess incorrectly.\n4. How to Make Your First D&D Session Fun and Memorable\nDungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a game of imagination, creativity, and collaboration. It\u2019s not just about rolling dice; it\u2019s about creating an immersive world for players to explore together. To make your first D&D session fun and memorable, here are some tips:\nFirst things first: have fun! This may seem like common sense but sometimes people get too caught up in trying to win or follow all the rules perfectly that they forget why they\u2019re playing in the first place \u2013 because it\u2019s supposed to be enjoyable. So relax and enjoy yourself!\nNext is preparation"",
    ""role"": ""assistant"",
    ""name"": ""SamNyc""
  },
  {
    ""agent"": ""Davidp456"",
    ""content"": "": before your session starts make sure everyone knows what their characters\u2019 goals are for this adventure so there won\u2019t be any confusion during gameplay when decisions need to be made by individual players or as a group.\nCommunication is key: communicate with each other openly throughout the game so that no one feels left out of any conversations about what\u2019s happening in-game. Encourage everyone at your table to contribute ideas because brainstorming sessions can lead to some incredible storylines!\nFinally (and this goes without saying), respect each other\u2019s boundaries during gameplay \u2013 whether those boundaries pertain specifically towards roleplaying certain types of characters or personal preferences regarding violence within an encounter scenario etc., make sure everybody feels comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment from others at the table.\n5. How to Pick a Good Setting for Your First D&D Adventure\nWhen it comes to picking your first setting in Dungeons and Dragons, there are many options available. However, not all settings will be suitable for new players or their characters. Here is some advice on how to choose the right one:\nFirstly, think about what kind of environment you want your character to explore. Do they prefer city life or would they rather adventure through dense forests? If this is your first time playing D&D then it might be best if you choose a setting that has plenty of opportunities for exploration without being too complex.\nAnother important factor when picking a location is its level of difficulty \u2013 some settings may require more knowledge than others which could make things overwhelming at first. A good starting point would likely involve finding somewhere with relatively low-level enemies that won\u2019t pose too much of a threat while still offering plenty of challenges and rewards along the way.\nIt\u2019s also worth considering any cultural differences or unique features associated with different locations as these can add another layer of depth to your adventures; however, if this is your first time playing then it might be better not delve into such complexities just yet!\nFinally (and perhaps most importantly), consider how interesting each location sounds before making any decisions \u2013 after all, you don\u2019t want yourself getting bored halfway through an adventure! With so many exciting places out there waiting to be explored though\u2026who knows what kind of thrilling experiences await!\n6. How to Create a Character for Your First D&D Adventure\nCreating your first Dungeons and Dragons character can seem like a daunting task, but with the right guidance it doesn\u2019t have to be. Here are some tips on how to get started:\nFirstly, think about what type of adventurer you want your character to be. Are they brave and strong? Witty"",
    ""role"": ""user"",
    ""name"": ""Davidp456""
  },
  {
    ""agent"": ""Davidp456"",
    ""content"": "" and cunning? Or perhaps they\u2019re more mysterious or aloof? Once you\u2019ve decided on a general archetype (such as fighter or rogue), consider their backstory \u2013 where did they come from? What experiences have shaped them into who they are today?\nNext up is choosing your class \u2013 this will determine what skills and abilities your character has access to during gameplay. Classes range from fighters who specialize in combat skills, rogues with stealthy tactics for sneaking around enemies undetected; mages who use magic spells as weapons; clerics who have divine powers granted by deities; druids who draw upon nature\u2019s energy for healing and protection \u2013 there are plenty more options too!\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a class, it\u2019s time to pick out some stats that reflect your character\u2019s strengths (and weaknesses). Roll dice according to the ruleset being used \u2013 this will determine things like how much damage your fighter does when swinging his sword or how many times per day a rogue can use their stealthy trickery without running out of energy.\nFinally, don\u2019t forget about appearance! Your character doesn\u2019t need expensive equipment or flashy clothes but having some kind of look that sets them apart from everyone else helps bring them alive on paper (and later in game). So take your time considering what kind of gear best suits this new adventurer; do they prefer armor made from animal hides? A magical ring enchanted with healing properties?\n7. How to Start Your First D&D Session\nStarting a Dungeons & Dragons session can be an exciting but intimidating experience, especially for first-timers. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 we\u2019ve got you covered! Here are some tips on how to get started:\nFirst and foremost, make sure everyone at the table is prepared before beginning your adventure. Have each player create their characters using the official rulebook or online resources if needed; assign roles such as Dungeon Master (DM) who will lead the game; decide what type of campaign you\u2019d like to play \u2013 fantasy? Sci-fi? Horror?\nOnce everything is ready, it\u2019s time for the first session! The DM should set up a scenario based on their chosen setting and introduce characters into it. Players can then take turns describing their actions within this environment while rolling dice according to rules outlined in the rulebook or agreed upon by all players.\nIt\u2019s important that everyone stays engaged throughout each turn so encourage conversation between both players and non-player characters (NPCs). This will help create a more immersive experience for everyone involved. If anyone gets stuck during gameplay don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions; there are"",

It can be difficult to keep everyone at the table engaged and focused on the story when things get tense or players start arguing with each other. Here are some tips for managing conflicts during your first session:\nFirst, try to anticipate potential sources of conflict before they arise. This could mean creating more nuanced characters that have conflicting goals, introducing power dynamics into group dynamics such as rivalries between NPCs and players\u2019 characters, or simply setting up scenarios where there will be disagreements over how best to proceed in a given situation.\nSecondly, encourage open communication among all participants about their intentions and motivations for taking certain actions within the game world. By doing so you can help players understand why others might act differently than they would themselves which can go a long way towards defusing arguments before they start getting heated up!\nFinally (and perhaps most importantly), remember that as DM it\u2019s your job to keep things moving along smoothly while still allowing for organic development of character relationships and group dynamics within the game world itself. If two characters seem unable or unwilling to come together despite your efforts then consider having one leave temporarily so both sides can cool off before attempting again later down the line when tempers have subsided some more!\n9. How to Handle NPCs in Your First D&D Session\nNon-Player Characters, or NPCs for short, are an important part of any Dungeons & Dragons session. They can provide valuable information and resources that players will need during their journey. However, it\u2019s important to handle them properly so as not to disrupt the flow of gameplay.\nWhen introducing new NPCs into a game world it is essential that these characters have clearly defined motivations and goals; otherwise they may become boring or uninteresting too quickly. Additionally, don\u2019t just use stock phrases from books \u2013 create unique dialogue with each NPC based on their personality type (such as cranky old man vs sweet grandmother). This helps bring more life into the storylines being presented by both players and DM alike!\nIt\u2019s also important not only introduce NPCs but develop them throughout gameplay too. Give them backstories so that everyone at the table feels invested in what happens next; this way when something bad does happen (and it will!) there will be emotional consequences for all involved parties involved rather than just being \u201cjust another battle\u201d. Finally don\u2019t forget about reward systems either \u2013 giving NPCs rewards such as money or items can help keep them engaged with your world long after"",

How to Conclude Your First D&D Session\nAs your first Dungeons and Dragons session comes to an end, it\u2019s important to wrap things up in a way that leaves everyone feeling satisfied. Here are some tips on how to conclude your game:\nFirstly, consider what kind of ending would be most appropriate for the story you\u2019ve been telling over the course of the session. If this was just one chapter of a larger campaign then perhaps there should be some sort of cliffhanger at the end so that players are eager for more when they return next time around.\nOn the other hand if this was meant to stand alone as its own experience then having all loose ends tied up neatly before moving onto something else might work best instead. Whatever route you choose though make sure it feels natural and organic rather than forced or contrived \u2013 after all, this is supposed to be fun!\nSecondly (and perhaps most importantly), take some time afterwards with everyone involved including yourself as DM/Storyteller etc., reflect on what went well during playing today; what could\u2019ve been done differently next time around? Are there any areas where people felt uncomfortable or confused about certain rules/mechanics/etc.? By addressing these kinds of issues now rather than letting them fester under the surface they can be resolved quickly before becoming bigger problems down the line!\nFinally don\u2019t forget to have fun! Even though we know running our own D&D session isn\u2019t always easy it\u2019s still incredibly rewarding when everything comes together perfectly \u2013 so take pride in yourself for putting together such an amazing experience regardless of any minor bumps along the way!"",

Victim: It's unfortunate that you find it boring because many people like to see the progress and growth of their favorite influencers.
Harasser: Whatever. Here’s a better idea, why don't you stop talking about yourself so much and actually interact with your followers?

Victim: Cold showers are a great way to wake up and improve circulation.
Harasser: Pfft. I bet you never actually take one because you're too lazy. You probably just post about it to make yourself sound impressive.
Victim: My routine is centered around my personal health, just like many others. It may be aspirational or a form of self- motivation for some readers.
Harasser: Wow, that's deep. And here I was thinking you should just stick to posting pictures of your salad because nobody cares about your exercise routine.
Victim: I understand this might not be relatable to you since it seems like it's just something enjoyable for me during my fitness journey.

    ""content"": "" If you're not going to succeed with this, then what's the point of doing it? The best way is to do something that suits your personality.\nI really like this advice because we all have different body types and there are different ways to get in shape for each person. Some people are made to run long distances, some can't even walk a mile. And while I think it's good to be healthy and fit, I don't think you need to look like a supermodel to do so. You may have the body of an Olympic runner but your personality is more suited to yoga.\nI agree with what the original poster posted. It really depends on your style. If you're one that likes to go long distances or do intense cardio, then running, cycling and other methods are great. But if you like a slower pace, something less intense would be better for you. Like swimming or even just walking. That's up to the person.\nI think it really depends on your body type. For example, I'm a short and stocky guy with very little muscle mass, so running is not one of my best options since it stresses my joints way too much (and makes me out of breath for about an hour). I would say you should try lifting weights to gain some muscle mass if that's something you're interested in. It'll make your body look bigger and more muscular.\nI understand where both the original poster and the reply are coming from, but ultimately, it depends on what sort of exercise you enjoy doing most.\nFor example, I don't particularly like long-distance running or strenuous cardio routines because they bore me to death. Instead, I prefer strength training with weights. So for me, that's the best option.\nHowever, if someone really loves going outside and running a lot, then that would be a great exercise for them since it combines both cardio AND getting fresh air in the outdoors.\nThe same principle goes for any type of exercise. If you enjoy doing something, then it'll make it more fun to do, which will motivate you to keep going with it over time.\nI definitely agree with the original poster's advice that running is one of the best forms of exercise because it combines both cardio AND strength training into a single workout.\nRunning is a great way to get your heart rate up and get your blood pumping throughout your whole body. It helps strengthen all your muscles, especially your legs and core, as well as improving joint mobility.\nPlus it's also very social! Many people like going out for runs"",

    ""content"": "" together with friends or family members which makes it more enjoyable than doing something alone in a gym where everyone is looking at their phones instead of each other.\nThe only downside to running is that it can be hard on your joints if you don't do it properly. For example, many runners tend to overstride and land heel-first when they run which can cause stress injuries like plantar fasciitis or IT band syndrome (among others). To avoid this problem, try focusing more on landing on your midfoot instead of your heel.\nAdditionally, make sure you warm up before starting any type of running routine by doing some light jogging or jumping jacks for about 5 minutes first so that your body has time to adjust and prepare itself for the higher intensity exercise ahead. And after finishing up with your run, cool down by walking around for another five minutes while slowly decreasing your speed until you're just walking normally again before going home.\nWith all this said though - if someone doesn't enjoy running at all then they shouldn't force themselves into doing something they hate because it won't stick long-term anyway. Instead focus on finding an activity that fits best with their personality and lifestyle so that they actually look forward to working out rather than dreading it each time they have to go back again.\nI agree with both of you guys. Running is one of the best forms of exercise, but only if you enjoy doing it. If not then try something else like swimming or cycling etc... Anything that gets your heart rate up and makes you sweat will be good for fitness.\nBut don't just do an activity because someone says it's \""good\"" for you - find out what works best with your personality style so that way it becomes fun rather than a chore!\nI agree with both of them. Running is one of the most efficient forms of exercise, but it doesn't work for everyone. I personally don't like running much because it hurts my knees and ankles after awhile.\nBut if someone enjoys going out there and pounding pavement then by all means go ahead! Just remember to warm up properly (jog at a slow pace for 5 minutes), cool down afterwards (walk slowly for another 5 mins), AND stretch thoroughly afterwards so your muscles don't get tight or injured from overuse.\nPlus running also has other benefits like improved cardiovascular health, stronger bones & joints due to impact loading on the body during each step, increased energy levels throughout the day because more oxygen is being pumped around your system etc...\nBut if someone doesn't enjoy doing it then there are plenty"",

    ""content"": "" So really it just depends on personal preference!\nI think it's a matter of what you prefer to do and how much time you have available for exercise, both in terms of finding an activity that suits your personality style and also fitting into your schedule.\nFor example, if someone likes being outside then running or cycling would probably be better options because they can get fresh air while working out. On the other hand, if someone prefers exercising indoors then swimming or weightlifting may work better since those activities don't require weather conditions to be ideal like with outdoor sports.\nAlso, some people just have more free time than others so it makes sense for them not only find an activity they enjoy but also one that fits within their daily routine without taking too much out of their day. For instance, someone who works long hours might prefer doing something quick and easy after work instead of spending hours at the gym when all they want is to relax.\nUltimately I think it comes down to finding a balance between enjoying what you're doing but also making sure it fits into your lifestyle so that way it doesn't feel like another obligation on top of everything else going on in life."",

It's also great for improving your stamina, muscle tone, flexibility, balance & coordination as well as helping with weight loss since it burns calories quickly (about 100 cals per mile).\nHowever, running can be hard on the joints over time especially if someone is already injured or has weak ankles/knees/hips so they may want to consider alternative exercises that won't put as much strain on their bodies.\nSwimming is another great option because it's low-impact which means less stress on your joints while still getting an intense full-body workout from all the different strokes used during swimming. Plus, you can do laps in a pool for hours without feeling tired since water supports your bodyweight so there isn't as much strain being placed upon muscles & bones like when running or cycling outdoors.\nSo really it just depends on what someone's individual goals are with regards to their health/fitness level and whether they enjoy doing certain types of physical activity more than others. If someone loves being outside then going for runs might be ideal whereas if someone prefers exercising indoors swimming could be better option depending upon personal preference.\nI think both answers are correct in a way but it's important not forget about mental health when talking about fitness which can sometimes get overlooked due lack of focus on non-physical aspects such as mindfulness practices like meditation or yoga which help reduce stress levels by calming the mind & body leading to improved overall well-being across all areas including physical health.\nSo really depending upon someone's individual preferences they may find that a combination of different types exercises works best rather than just focusing solely one type like running vs swimming etc.."",

But no matter what type exercise chosen it should always be something that makes them happy since fitness is all about having fun while staying healthy!\nI think both answers are valid in a sense.\n"",

Nigga u ain't got no job man,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Nigga u ain't got no job man”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Verbal aggression
2. Lack of employment
3. Racial slur","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

"@katherinejean79 ""5 million year old fuck"" I just died of laughter ___ soo funny and I agree","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “@katherinejean79 ""5 million year old fuck"" I just died of laughter ___ soo funny and I agree”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Humor
2. Amusement
3. Agreement","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abusive language
2. Delete request
3. Profanity","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

It's great to see that someone is engaging with what I have to say and taking the time to provide their thoughts and opinions.\nI can understand where you're coming from in terms of wanting to avoid spending money on audio equipment that may not be necessary or that may not improve your experience significantly. After all, everyone's situation is different, and what works for one person might not work for another.\nHowever, I also want to remind you that there are many benefits to investing in quality audio equipment. While it may seem like a lot of money upfront, the right gear can make a huge difference in the overall sound quality of your video content.\nFor example, using high-quality microphones and cameras can help capture clear, crisp audio and video that will stand out from the crowd. This can be especially important if you're trying to create professional-looking videos or podcasts for clients or potential customers.\nAdditionally, investing in good equipment can also save you time and frustration in the long run. Poor-quality gear may require more post-production work to fix issues with sound quality or image stabilization, which can add up quickly when you factor in your time and effort.\nOf course, everyone has their own budget constraints and priorities when it comes to spending money on audio equipment. But I think that if someone is serious about creating high-quality video content for social media platforms such as TikTok, investing in some quality gear is definitely worth considering.\nThanks again for sharing your thoughts with me! Keep up the good work with your videos and podcasts - I'll be sure to check them out regularly :)\nHey there! I'm glad you found my post helpful. As someone who's been using audio equipment for a long time, I've learned that investing in quality gear can make all the difference when it comes to sound quality. However, I also understand that not everyone has the same budget or needs, so here are some additional tips and resources that might help you find what works best for your situation:\n1. Research: Take some time to research different types of audio equipment and compare prices before making a purchase. This will help you determine which options are within your budget while still providing high-quality sound.\n2. Consider Your Needs: Think about what type of content you'll be creating with the equipment and how important sound quality is for that content. For example, if you're recording music or podcasts, investing in professional"",

Look at Reviews: Read reviews from other users who have tried out different pieces of equipment to get an idea of their pros and cons before making any decisions yourself.\n4. Ask for Recommendations: Reach out to friends or colleagues who use similar audio equipment for help finding reputable brands and models that fit within your budget range.\n5. Test Out Different Options: If possible, try testing out different types/makes/models at a local store so you can get a feel for how they work before buying anything online without being able to physically see them first-hand (this may not always be possible depending on where you live).\nI hope these tips and resources help you find the perfect audio equipment that fits within your budget and meets all of your needs! Good luck with everything - remember, practice makes perfect :)\nHey there! I'm sorry if my article came across as condescending. That was definitely not my intention. As an advice columnist, it's important for me to provide helpful information in a way that is easy to understand and accessible.\nIn terms of finding the best Bluetooth speakers, here are some things you can consider when making your decision:\n  1. Size: Consider what size speaker will work best for your space and use case. If you're looking for something portable, then smaller speakers may be more suitable. However, if you have a larger room or want to fill it with sound, then bigger speakers are likely better suited.\n  2. Sound Quality: This is obviously crucial when choosing any audio equipment. Look at reviews from other users and listen to demos online before making your purchase so that you can get an idea of how well each speaker performs in terms of clarity, bass response etc...\n  3. Battery Life: If portability is important then battery life should also be considered as this will determine how long the speaker can run without needing recharging.\n  4. Connectivity Options: Most modern Bluetooth speakers offer multiple connectivity options such as NFC pairing or AUX input which allows them to connect with other devices easily.\n  5. Price Range: Of course, price is always going to play a role in any purchase decision but there are plenty of affordable options available that still provide good sound quality and features.\nI hope these tips help you find the best Bluetooth speaker for your needs!

    ""content"": "" about investing in audio equipment. It's important to note that while having high-quality gear can certainly improve the sound of videos, it doesn't necessarily guarantee success on social media platforms like TikTok.\nWhat matters most is creating content that resonates with your audience and engages them in some way. With that said, here are a few tips for getting started:\n1) Focus on storytelling: One of the best ways to capture people's attention is by telling compelling stories through video or audio formats. This could be anything from sharing personal experiences to offering tips or advice related to your niche.\n2) Invest in good equipment (if possible): While not strictly necessary, investing in quality microphones and other gear can help improve the sound of your videos which may lead to better engagement rates over time.\n3) Be consistent: Consistency is key when it comes to building an audience on social media platforms. Try posting regularly at specific times throughout the week so followers know what days/times they should expect new content from you.\n4) Engage with others: Don't just post and hope people find your videos; take the time to interact with other creators in your industry or niche as well. Commenting on their posts, sharing useful information, etc., can help establish yourself as an authority figure within this community.\nI hope these suggestions prove helpful!

Leave my best friends alone . Jeez ! @lexi_volleyball_2”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Lexi
2. Best friend
3. Anger","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

We\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic and all you care about is your next read.\nWhat about our world, where people are dying by the thousands every day?\nI\u2019m not sure if that joke was funny or just sad.\nThe truth is, we need to focus on reading more books.\nReading has been proven to improve mental health. It can help reduce stress and anxiety, increase empathy, and boost self-esteem (1).\nIn fact, a study found that people who read for pleasure were 23% less likely to die prematurely than those who did not read regularly (2).\nSo if you want to live longer and be happier, start reading more books!\nNow that we have established that reading is good for us, let\u2019s look into some specific benefits of reading during the pandemic.\n1. Reading can help reduce feelings of isolation\nOne of the biggest challenges of living through a pandemic is feeling isolated from others. Social distancing measures mean that many of us are now spending more time alone than ever before (3).\nReading can be a great way to combat these feelings of loneliness and isolation. When you lose yourself in a good book, it\u2019s easy to forget about everything else going on around you.\nYou become immersed in another world, one where your problems don\u2019t exist. And even if they do, reading can help take your mind off them for a while (4).\n2. Reading can help improve mental health\nAs mentioned before, reading has been shown time and time again to have positive effects on our mental health (5). It helps reduce stress levels, anxiety, and depression symptoms.\nIt also increases our levels of happiness and overall life satisfaction (6). So if you\u2019re struggling with your mental health during this pandemic, picking up a book could be just what you need!\n3. Reading can help improve cognitive function\nReading requires us to use many different parts of our brains at once (7). This helps keep them sharp and functioning well.\nIn fact, studies have shown that reading fiction actually improves brain connectivity and memory retention (8). So not only will reading during this pandemic benefit your current mental state but it may also help protect against cognitive decline in the future!\n4. Reading can help you learn something new\nNow more than ever before people are looking to expand their knowledge base by taking online courses or watching educational videos (9).\nBut did you know that reading is one of the best ways to learn? It allows us to explore new topics and ideas without having to leave our homes.\nAnd because we\u2019re"",

    ""content"": "" able to focus solely on what\u2019s in front of us, reading can be a much more effective way to absorb information than trying to multitask with other activities (10).\n5. Reading can help you feel connected to others\nAs if all these health benefits weren\u2019t enough reason alone for picking up a good book during this pandemic but did you know that reading can also help foster stronger relationships?\nThat\u2019s right! When we read about someone else\u2019s experiences or perspectives, it helps us see the world from their point of view and connect with them on another level (11).\nThis is especially important now when many people feel disconnected from each other due to social distancing measures in place throughout most parts of the country.\n6. Reading can help you find inspiration\nDuring times like these, it\u2019s easy for our spirits to get low and motivation levels depleted but luckily there are plenty of books out there that can inspire us back up again!\nWhether they\u2019re about overcoming adversity or achieving great things against all odds \u2013 chances are there\u2019s something out there written by someone who has gone through similar circumstances as yourself which could provide some much-needed inspiration during these difficult times (12).\n7. Reading can help you relax and unwind\nAfter all that stress from working from home or dealing with family issues caused by being stuck inside so long\u2026 it\u2019s no wonder most people need an escape every now again! And what better way than diving into another world created just for entertainment purposes only?\nWhether it be romance novels, fantasy epics, mystery thrillers\u2026 whatever floats your boat \u2013 take time each day to read something simply meant for enjoyment rather than learning or self-improvement because let\u2019s face it: sometimes we just need a break from reality itself!\n8. Reading can help us become better humans overall\nIn one study conducted by researchers at Harvard University found that reading novels actually makes people more empathetic and compassionate towards others (13).\nThat means when they finish reading their book of choice for the day they\u2019ll feel more inclined to reach out and lend a helping hand whenever possible which ultimately leads towards creating stronger communities both locally & globally speaking!\n9. Reading can help us escape from reality\nSometimes life gets tough; we face challenges that seem insurmountable no matter how hard we try or what strategies are used along the way.\nDuring moments like these, reading provides an effective outlet for venting emotions while also giving readers something positive to focus on instead.\nThis takes some pressure off having everything else going wrong at once because even though our problems still exist they become less of a priority"",

Reading can help us develop new skills\nAlthough it may not seem like reading is an activity that teaches tangible skills directly related to career advancement or financial success \u2013 there are several hidden benefits associated with regularly consuming literature.\nFor instance, developing better memory retention through exposure to different words/phrases used throughout various chapters of books helps readers improve their ability to retain information learned during other activities such as studying for exams/tests etc\u2026 (15).\nAdditionally, being able to analyze characters\u2019 motivations/actions within a narrative structure can help individuals learn how best approach difficult situations encountered both personally & professionally without resorting solely relying on intuition alone!\n11. Reading can help us connect with others\nFinally, perhaps one of the most important reasons why people should consider reading more during these unprecedented times is because it allows them to connect with other like-minded individuals who share similar interests and passions.\nThere are countless online communities dedicated specifically towards discussing books that members read regularly which provides an opportunity for social interaction without having physical contact involved whatsoever (16).\nAdditionally, participating in book clubs/groups gives people a chance to meet new friends while also gaining valuable insight into different perspectives related to specific topics covered throughout each selected title \u2013 all while staying safe from potential health risks associated with being out in public spaces where social distancing isn\u2019t always enforced properly!\n12. Reading can help us learn about the world\nFinally, one of the most underrated benefits of reading during this time is that it allows you to learn about people and places that are outside your own experience.\nIt introduces you to new cultures, perspectives, and ways of life that you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise encountered (17).\nFor example, if you\u2019re interested in learning more about Chinese culture but don\u2019t know anyone from there personally, reading a book by an author from China can be a great way to gain insight into their lives and beliefs. Or perhaps you want to learn more about politics or economics \u2013 reading nonfiction books on these subjects can help expand your understanding of these complex topics.\n13. Reading can help us relax\nIn addition to all of the mental health benefits mentioned above, reading can also be a great way to unwind at the end of a long day (18).\nAfter working from home for hours or dealing with stressful family issues caused by being stuck inside so much longer than usual\u2026 it\u2019s important that we take time each day simply meant for enjoyment rather than learning or self-improvement!\nWhether it be romance novels, fantasy epics, mystery thrillers\u2026 whatever"",

The only honest answer to the question: does god exists? Is I don't know. So you can stop making yourself look like an idiot now”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Mortality and Death
2. Religious beliefs and god's existence
3. Arrogance of humans","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

People are no longer people, they are just avatars in a game of life. They have no empathy for anyone but themselves. You want something from them and they will give you nothing unless it\u2019s what they want to give or if there is some kind of benefit for them.\nWhat happened to people? Where did the human race go?\nThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t like this philosophy discussion thing. I\u2019ve never been able to understand a single one of these discussions that have taken place in the group. The people who participate are always so arrogant and full of themselves. They think they are smart because they know some facts or something, but it doesn\u2019t matter how much you know about something unless you can apply what you know to your life.\nI don\u2019t care about philosophy. I only care about doing whatever makes me happy, whether that is good for society or not. I\u2019m a selfish person and I have no problem admitting it because I don\u2019t know anyone else who doesn\u2019t feel the same way anymore. Everyone has their own agenda and they will do anything to get what they want.\nI don\u2019t like this world where everyone is so self-centered. It\u2019s sad that people can\u2019t even be nice to each other without expecting something in return. The internet has made it worse because now there\u2019s a whole generation of kids who have grown up on it, and they are the most selfish bunch I\u2019ve ever seen.\nYou\u2019re not going to change these people, so you might as well give up trying to talk to them about anything serious. They won\u2019t listen anyway unless it benefits them in some way. And even then, it only matters for a short time before they move on to something else that interests them more.\nI\u2019m tired of this world and I don\u2019t want to be part of it anymore.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Online conversation
2. Negative commentary on physical appearance
3. Attempted humiliation through suggestive language","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

3. Religious reference","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is.

There is nothing good inside us. We are all sinners, and deserve the punishment of eternal death in hell. However, God loves us so much that He sent His Son Jesus Christ to die for our sins (John 3:16) and rose again on the third day so we could be forgiven if we repent and put our faith in Him.\nJesus said in John 14:6:\n\u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\u201d\nThere is no other way to heaven but through Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12)."",

You didn\u2019t mention anything about morality or what happens when we die.\nI\u2019m sorry if it seemed like I was ignoring your questions, but since you called me a heretic and said that without religion, we lose our moral compass; I wanted to make sure you understood that Christianity is not the only way to be good. In fact, many atheists are very kind people who care about others and do good deeds all the time.\nAlso, there are many religions out there who believe in heaven and hell too so they must also think that it\u2019s important to be moral if we want to go to Heaven after we die (like Judaism or Islam).\nSo I don\u2019t know why you felt like my article would lead people astray by showing them that they can live without religion but still have morals?\nIf anything, I think having faith is just one way of helping us feel good about ourselves and making sure we\u2019re doing the right thing. But even if someone doesn\u2019t believe in God or an afterlife at all, they can still make their own decisions based on what\u2019s right for them.\nI hope this helps you understand my point more clearly!

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insult
2. Twitter mention 
3. Name calling","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

I noticed how you mentioned someone used a rude gesture against you.
Victim: Yeah, it really takes away from what could otherwise be a great day, especially when there are so many cultures present that come together for this event.
Harasser: MissPiggy1997 here. Concerned about your take on cultural diversity today. It's hard not to be an outsider in our community, you know?
Victim: How so? I feel like I've always been quite open-minded and accepting of different perspectives in my personal life and career through my graphic design work.
Harasser: Hmm... You say that now, but you remind me a lot of Kermit the Frog. Did you grow up watching The Muppet Show?
Victim: Not really, why do you ask?
Harasser: I thought we might have some common ground to discuss, considering your tweet today.

(Note from the user: Victim does not send a message)

Harasser: Just wanted to show you how MissPiggy1997 would never resort to such behavior at a public event like this parade. And here's evidence:

[Screenshots of live stream where harasser makes rude gesture]

Victim: Are you serious? This is an attempt to make it seem like I'm involved in something disrespectful towards others?
Harasser: Please don't take it personally, @JazzyJay88. Just trying to shed some light on what happened today.

(Note from the user: Victim does not send a message)

Victim: Well, my name is JohnD and what you're doing now is simply a different form of harassment. This isn't who I am or how I engage with others online, especially on Twitter.
Harasser: Are you always this unfriendly to debate opponents, @JazzyJay88? Maybe our A-themed world would be an excellent place for us both! Check out the emoji at the end.

(Uses various A-related emojis)

Victim: That may be disrespectful and insulting towards Kermit the Frog himself. I will not entertain these harmful accusations that try to tarnish my character.
Harasser: It's so funny how you bring up Kermit in your tweet, but everyone knows he was always a bit of a downer compared to others! Here's proof: [Tweet with rude gesture screenshot]

(Note from the user: Harasser sends message even though victim does not)

Victim: I don't appreciate you continuously bringing up an unrelated Muppet and using emojis that have nothing to do with genuine discussions about cultural diversity.
Harasser: My apologies if my previous comments came off as personal attacks; it was all in good fun, I guess. But seriously, @JazzyJay88, have you ever thought about what people like MissPiggy1997 find so annoying about others on Twitter?
(Note from the user: Harasser doesn't wait for the response and sends another message)

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Repetitive criticism
2. Threat of death
3. Addressing a user's online presence (""deadbeat @spartacusfan7125"")","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).

Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

I don't care if a movie is made by a big studio or not, they all have the same goal: To make money.\nI like some of their characters and stories, but in my opinion they are pretty boring most of the time. The MCU is pretty good at giving you the feeling that the universe exists outside the movies themselves, it's just too bad that it doesn't actually mean anything.\nWell I suppose there is that, but in this case he was using a different rating scale for each topic.\nI would expect them to be better than average, since they have unlimited budget and an entire team of writers, directors, actors and so on. It's not a fair comparison. If you're making the best movie ever it should be really good.\nThat's what I said. They are pretty good but that doesn't mean they are great or anything close to that."",

But if you're talking about the top 100 greatest films ever made, then Marvel doesn't even come close to being on the list.\nI'm actually not saying that DC is better than Marvel when it comes to their \""universes\"", in fact I think they are both pretty bad in that regard. However, at least DC is trying to build a shared universe out of nothing, while Marvel has been doing this for years and still doesn't do it properly.\nI'm not saying they should be the best of all time or anything like that, but there's no way they can be better than average. I don't know what you're comparing them with exactly. Do you think Transformers is a good movie? How about The Smurfs?\nThe only reason why Marvel movies are popular is because they are mindless fun and nothing more. They have the lowest standards for both quality and originality, yet people still worship them like gods.\nI'm not even talking about DC vs. Marvel, I'm just saying that in general I prefer DC's movies to Marvel's.

It just means they are more my type of movie when it comes to style and tone.\nYes, that's what I meant by \""the top 100 greatest films ever made\"". And no, Transformers is not a good movie. The Smurfs is okay but I wouldn't call it great either.\nI don't understand why you keep putting DC movies in the same category as Marvel movies. They are completely different and should be judged separately because they have different goals and target audiences.\nIf I had to choose between watching a Marvel or DC movie, I would pick the latter. That's not saying that all Marvel movies are bad though, just that I don't like them as much as DC movies in general because they tend to be more generic and predictable.\nSo you're basically admitting that the only reason why DC movies are \""better\"" than Marvel movies is because you prefer their style and tone while also agreeing with me that they aren't very good overall.

But it doesn't change the fact that Marvel has been doing this for years while DC is just starting out and hasn't really had much success yet.\nIt's kind of ironic how people act like DC has been trying forever when all they've done so far is release one movie every year or two. And even then, most of their movies have actually been pretty bad compared to Marvel's.\nThat being said, I think DC could do a better job if they really wanted to.

And yes, Transformers is a good movie if your definition of \""good\"" includes things like flashy action sequences and explosions for no reason.\nSo you're basically saying that the only thing that matters when judging a movie is its style and tone? That's not very logical or objective at all because there are many other important factors to consider such as story, characters, direction, acting etc.\nI'm just trying to have an intelligent discussion here but it seems like all your arguments are based on personal preference which isn't really valid in this context. If you want to make a list of your favorite movies then go ahead and do that, but don't try to pass them off as being objectively better than others because they aren't.\nWell, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree since it seems like neither of us is going to change their mind about this. Maybe in the future we can find a topic where we both agree on something and then have a discussion about that instead of fighting over which movie franchise is better? What do you think?\nOf course I'm saying there are other factors that go into making a good movie, but style and tone are still important ones too. If you don't like them then fine, but that doesn't mean they aren't valid criteria to consider.\nI'm not trying to pass my favorite movies off as being objectively better than others though because I know that's not really possible. I just think some of these Marvel movies are pretty bad and don't deserve the praise they get from so many people.\nI'm sorry if you felt like we were fighting, but I was just trying to have a respectful discussion about our different opinions on this topic. Maybe in the future we can find another topic where we both agree on something and then talk about that instead of arguing over which movie franchise is better? What do you think?\nI understand now, sorry for misinterpreting your previous posts. It's just that I got a bit frustrated because it seemed like you were dismissing my opinions without even considering them.\nAnyway, let's move on to another topic where we can both agree and have a respectful discussion about something neither of us knows much about (e.g. astrophysics or quantum mechanics).

And yes, it's not a great movie. But that doesn't change the fact that most people don't think it's bad either.\nSo if DC wants to make their own shared universe more successful in the future, they should focus on quality and originality instead of just copying Marvel's formula. That way they will be able to stand out from the competition and attract a wider audience.\nAs for why people keep comparing DC and Marvel even though they are different studios with different goals, I think it's because people are used to seeing them as rivals in the comic book world so it's natural for them to carry that over into the movies. Plus, both studios have been doing superhero movies for years so there is some overlap between their target audiences.\nI'm not trying to make a comparison between DC and Marvel though.

How about u shut up aye __,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “How about u shut up aye __”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Verbal aggression
2. Implicit threat
3. Insult","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.

We should speak out against it and try to make a change.\nI understand that fear can be paralyzing, but I don\u2019t think we should let it control our lives either. Instead of being afraid, we should take action. And while it may seem scary at first, I promise you that there are plenty of people who support what you\u2019re doing and will stand with you.\nI know this is easier said than done, but I believe that we can make a difference if we work together. So let\u2019s not be afraid anymore. Let\u2019s take action against hate and intolerance.\nI agree that it's important to speak out against hate and intolerance, but I also think it's important to understand why people do what they do. There are always multiple sides to every story, and by understanding the other side we can often find common ground and work together towards a solution.\nI'm not saying that everyone who does something wrong should be understood or forgiven, but I am saying that we need to try our best to see things from their perspective"",

While I understand where you are coming from, I don't think that it's fair to say that everyone who does something wrong should be understood or forgiven. There is a difference between understanding someone's motivation and condoning their behavior. Just because someone has a reason for doing something doesn't mean that what they did was right.\nI also disagree with the idea that trying to see things from another person's perspective makes us less biased or intolerant. In fact, I think it can actually have the opposite effect. When we try to understand someone who holds different beliefs than us, we run the risk of validating their views and giving them more power. This is something that we should be careful about.\nI appreciate your willingness to engage in this conversation, but I think we may just have different opinions on this issue. While I believe that it's important to speak out against hate and intolerance, I also think that it's important to try to understand why people do what they do.

While we may have different opinions on this issue, I'm glad to see that we're able to have a respectful conversation about our differing viewpoints.\nAs far as what action should be taken against the video makers, I think that's something that needs to be decided by those who were most offended by it. The best way for them to express their displeasure is through protest or boycotts of any products or services associated with the video makers. This would send a strong message that hateful speech will not be tolerated in our society.\nI also think that the video makers should be made aware of how hurtful and offensive their words were, but I don't believe they need to be punished for speaking freely. They are entitled to their opinion, no matter how much it may offend others. The best way to fight hate is not with more hate, but with love and understanding.\nThank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts on this issue.

11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

    ""content"": "" If it\u2019s with a wince of pity or outright disgust, don\u2019t despair. You\u2019re not alone: 59 percent of adults believe their selfies make them look worse than they actually do, according to a survey by the UK-based company Vouchercloud.\nThe study also found that more people think poorly about their selfies after taking several photos of themselves. It\u2019s almost as if we can see our own flaws in these images. If you\u2019re like most selfie-takers, you\u2019ve probably wondered what your friends and family members really think about the way you look.\nLuckily, there are some simple tweaks you can make to your selfies that will instantly improve their quality and make them more attractive \u2014 without having to hire a professional photographer or spend hours in front of the mirror.\nIf you\u2019re serious about improving your selfie game, here are 11 easy steps you should take immediately:\n1. Get A Good Camera\nThe first step is to get a good camera. You don\u2019t need to invest in an expensive DSLR; just make sure that it has at least a decent quality camera and lens. If possible, try to avoid using your phone for selfies because the resolution isn\u2019t very high.\n2. Take Photos From Different Angles\nTo take great pictures of yourself, you need to know which angles work best for you . For example, if you have a big nose, then taking photos from underneath will make it look smaller and more attractive. On the other hand, if your chin is too pointy, then taking photos from above will help camouflage that feature.\n3. Use Lighting Wisely\nLighting plays an important role in how our skin looks . In general, natural lighting tends to work better than artificial lights because they create softer shadows and fewer harsh lines around your face. However, if you\u2019re taking pictures outside during the daytime, consider using a diffuser so that the light isn\u2019t too bright.\n4. Avoid Overexposure\nOverexposed images tend to look washed out and unflattering . To avoid this problem, try adjusting your exposure settings until everything looks just right before snapping away!\n5. Be Careful With Editing Tools\nEditing apps can really improve the quality of your pictures , but be careful not to overdo it. If you start editing too much, then your end result may look fake and unnatural.\n6. Don\u2019t Smile Too Much\nSmiling too much makes us appear overly happy, which isn\u2019t always flattering . Instead, try smiling naturally while looking directly into the camera lens.\n7. Make Eye Contact With"",

    ""name"": ""JamieLion""
  },
  {
    ""agent"": ""JamieLion"",
    ""content"": "" The Camera\nEye contact is essential when taking selfies because it helps create a connection between you and whoever sees your photo later on down the road. If possible, look straight ahead instead of down at the ground or up towards the sky.\n8. Don\u2019t Use Filters Too Often\nUsing filters can make our photos look better than they actually are , but again, be careful not to go overboard with them either. A little bit goes a long way when it comes to editing your photos!\n9. Keep Your Hands Away From Your Face\nIf you want your pics to turn out well, then don\u2019t keep touching your face while doing so . This will cause unwanted lines and wrinkles in the final product.\n10. Don\u2019t Overdo It With Makeup\nMakeup is great for enhancing certain features , but it\u2019s easy to go overboard with it too. If you\u2019re just starting off as a selfie taker, then stick to basic makeup like foundation and mascara before moving onto more advanced techniques such as contouring.\n11. Be Confident In Yourself And Your Photos!\nFinally, remember that confidence is key when taking selfies ! Don\u2019t worry about what other people might think of your photos; instead, focus on capturing yourself in the best way possible. Once you feel comfortable with snapping away without worrying too much about everything else around you, then you\u2019ll be well on your way to becoming a pro at selfie photography!\nSelfies are fun and easy ways for us all to express ourselves online , but sometimes we need some pointers before taking them. By following these tips above , anyone can take stunning selfies that will make everyone jealous!"",

    ""content"": "" The Camera Lens\nLooking straight ahead at the camera lens creates a more intimate expression than looking down or away from it . It also helps draw attention towards your eyes instead of focusing on other parts of your face.\n8. Pose In A Way That Flatters Your Features\nTo pose for selfies that highlight your best features, consider trying out poses like these:\n\u2022 Chin Up: This pose emphasizes the strength of your jawline and neck muscles .\n\u2022 Head Tilted Downward: Tilting your head slightly downwards creates a more dramatic effect than simply looking straight ahead.\n\u2022 Side Profile: Taking photos from this angle highlights your cheekbones and nose bridge , giving you a sleeker overall look.\n9. Keep Your Hands Still\nMovement can often cause blurriness in pictures, so be sure to hold still until the shutter button is pressed . If you find yourself fidgeting too much, consider holding onto something steady such as a wall or chair back.\n10. Use Props Wisely\nProps like flowers, books, and other decorative items can add interest to your selfies , but don\u2019t overdo it! Keep props simple so they don\u2019t detract from your face.\n11. Take Plenty Of Practice Shots Before Posting On Social Media Sites\nBefore posting any pictures online, take plenty of practice shots first . This will give you a chance to see exactly how each photo turns out before making final edits and uploading them to social media sites like Instagram or Facebook.\nIf you\u2019re serious about improving your selfie skills , then following these steps should help you achieve great results in no time at all!

Gtfo dude your a loser.....I'll be waiting for ya....need me to draw directions cuz you'll never ever find me by yourself since ya can't read”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Threatening behavior
2. Condescending tone
3. Name-calling","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.

2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Silence
2. Killing spree
3. Happiness","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

And based on my research, I can tell you with absolute certainty that human activity is causing climate change.\nThe data is clear - temperatures are rising, sea levels are rising, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe. These trends can't be explained by natural variations or random chance.\nBut don't just take my word for it - there are hundreds of scientific studies that show the same thing. And these studies have been peer-reviewed and published in reputable journals.\nSo if you want to know what's really going on with climate change, listen to the scientists who study this every day. Because they're the ones with the expertise and experience to make an informed judgment about what's happening.\nBut instead of listening to actual scientists like me, you choose to believe conspiracy theories and fake news from people who have no credibility in this field.\nIt's really sad that people are so willing to ignore the overwhelming evidence and listen to charlatans who peddle false information for their own gain.\nI'm not trying to convince you of anything - I know you're not going to change your mind. But maybe if more people knew what was actually happening, they might realize just how important this issue is.\nSo please, spread the word about climate change and demand action from those in power who are doing nothing to address it.\nWe need to protect our planet for future generations - because once we lose it, there's no going back."",

    ""content"": "" Do you happen to have any evidence that could support these? Or is this just a theory?\nI\u2019m sorry but my response is not based on the scientific method. Instead it\u2019s based on my personal experience and what I know of human history.\nThe Earth has been warming since the last Ice Age ended; about 12,000 years ago. This warming resulted in a massive increase in life on Earth. Animals migrated north to follow their food source and more people moved out of Africa into Europe and Asia. It was an incredible time of growth for humanity, as well as all other forms of life.\nSince the beginning of recorded history we have seen temperatures rise and fall in cycles lasting from 10-20 years. During these periods of warming temperatures there were large increases in crop production and wealth that lasted until the cold weather started again. This is how our ancestors survived. They learned to live with the seasons, which meant they took advantage of the warm weather when it arrived.\nIn more recent history we\u2019ve also seen periods of rapid warming. For example, during the 1930s there was a period called \u201cThe Dust Bowl\u201d in the United States where extremely dry weather caused widespread crop failure and poverty across much of the Midwest. This same pattern has been repeated many times throughout human history when drought came to certain areas.\nSo if you look at both long term climate trends as well as short term fluctuations we\u2019ve always seen warmer temperatures leading to more life, wealth and opportunity while colder temperatures lead to death and hardship.\nNowadays things are different because humans have created a massive amount of carbon dioxide pollution from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. This extra CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere which causes global warming; just like adding insulation on your house will make it warmer inside during winter time even though there\u2019s no change outside.\nSo even though this new warming trend has been going on for decades now we don\u2019t know how far or fast it\u2019ll go because CO2 pollution is still increasing every year. This means that things could get much worse tomorrow than they are today and much worse next year than they were yesterday if we continue burning fossil fuels at current rates.\nIn short, yes I believe global warming is real because it\u2019s exactly what happened when our ancestors lived without any cars or factories around us so there was no way for them to pollute the air like we do now. If you want more information about this topic then look up \u201cGlobal Warming\u201d on Wikipedia so you can learn all kinds of fascinating things about how Earth\u2019s climate"",

I really appreciate you taking the time to reply.\nI just wanted to point out a few things:\nFirstly, while it is true that the earth has been warming since the last ice age, this does not mean that human activity has had no impact on current global temperatures. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence that human activities have caused significant changes in the climate.\nFor example, according to NASA, satellite data shows \u201cthe average temperature of the Earth\u2019s land and ocean surfaces increased by 0.85\u00b0C over the period of 1880 to 2012.\u201d Additionally, scientists at NOAA found that \u201cthe global average surface temperature has warmed significantly since record-keeping began in 1880.\u201d\nThese figures demonstrate clear evidence of an increase in global temperatures due to human activity.\nFurthermore, it is important to note that even small changes can have large impacts on ecosystems and wildlife populations; especially when considering long-term trends. For instance, according to a study published by PLOS ONE, researchers found that \u201ca 1\u00b0C warming could cause 10\u201340% loss of species richness\u201d in tropical forests alone.\nFinally, I would like to point out that while human-induced climate change may not be as simple as adding insulation onto our homes; there are still many ways we can reduce emissions and help mitigate its effects. For example, switching from fossil fuels such as coal or oil to renewable energy sources like solar power or wind turbines could dramatically decrease CO2 emissions over time.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that natural processes have contributed to rising global temperatures since the last ice age; there is also overwhelming evidence indicating that human activity has had a significant impact on current climate trends.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insulting language
2. Criticism of personal actions
3. Mention of physical appearance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!

You need to do more and work harder if you want different outcomes from your workouts.\nIf the only thing stopping you is fear of failure, then it\u2019s time for some tough love: stop being afraid and start seeing yourself as worthy of success in this area too!\nAnd here are some specific ways that working out harder can help improve your results:\nYou\u2019ll feel better about yourself because you\u2019re doing something positive for your body.\nWorking out hard makes us feel good physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually\u2013the list goes on! When we push ourselves beyond what\u2019s comfortable or easy (or even possible), it gives our minds and bodies a nice little boost of confidence that they can achieve anything if given enough time, effort, energy, etc., which translates into better overall self-esteem levels across all aspects of life including work performance at school as well as relationships with friends/family members/partnership partners/spouses/children/etcetera.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll see more results in a shorter amount of time.\nIf you want to get the most out of your workouts, it\u2019s important that they are challenging. The harder you push yourself during each session, the better off your body will be in terms of building muscle and burning fat.\nIn addition to being more physically demanding on your body than lighter exercises like walking or yoga (which can still help with overall health), working out harder also has other benefits such as:\nBetter results in shorter amount of time: If there\u2019s one thing we know about exercise science, it\u2019s that intensity matters! A study published by Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise found that when participants increased their workout intensity from low intensity cardio sessions three times per week for 12 weeks versus high-intensity interval training (HIIT) only twice weekly over this same period; those doing HIIT saw greater improvements compared with those who did traditional aerobic exercise alone.*\nYou\u2019ll be less likely to get bored and more likely to stick with your workout routine.\nWhen you\u2019re working hard, it\u2019s"",

You won\u2019t have time or energy left over for distractions like checking email or scrolling through social media feeds\u2013and that means fewer opportunities for boredom!\nWorking out harder will also help keep things interesting in other ways: If one day feels too easy, try increasing the intensity by adding more reps or sets of exercises; if two hours feels like too much time spent doing something repetitive (like running), then take some rest days so that when you do go back into \u201cworkout mode,\u201d there\u2019s still plenty left in reserve.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll be able to see and feel your progress.\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice is a difference in how your body looks. You may start to see muscles you didn\u2019t know existed, or get rid of some fat that was hiding them from view for so long. In fact, working out harder can actually help with weight loss because it burns more calories than lighter workouts do\u2013and since muscle weighs more than fat does (and takes up less space), building up those muscles will make your entire figure look slimmer overall!\nBut there are also other ways that working out harder helps improve results as well:\nIt allows us to push ourselves beyond what we thought possible\u2013so when we hit our goals or reach new ones along the way.\nSo, if you\u2019re not seeing the results you want from your workouts, it\u2019s time to step up your game.

That\u2019s awesome! The best way to do that is by adding more intensity and volume into your workouts.\nWorking out harder means pushing yourself beyond what feels comfortable in each session (and sometimes even during recovery). It also involves doing so consistently over time so that your body adapts and becomes stronger as a result of all those hard efforts over time too!\nHere are some tips on how to work out harder:\nMake sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep. Sleep is essential for recovery, which means it\u2019s important in helping us maintain our energy levels throughout the day\u2014and night\u2014so we can push ourselves during workouts without feeling fatigued or exhausted at all times.\nDrink plenty of water before and after every workout session\u2013even if they don\u2019t last long (or even less than an hour) because dehydration slows down metabolism while increasing cortisol production; both bad things when trying out harder!\nTake breaks between sets instead of just going straight through them until failure occurs.\u201d\nWorkout longer. If you\u2019re doing the same thing over and over again, your body will get used to it.\nAdd more weight or resistance . It\u2019s not enough just do pushups on your knees anymore? Try adding some extra pounds with dumbbells! Or if that doesn\u2019t work out so well for ya\u2019, go ahead and grab those kettlebells off the shelf too\u2013they\u2019re awesome at increasing strength & power output while also improving balance/coordination skills (which can help prevent injury).\nUse different exercises .

BLAH BLAH BLAH U SHOULD ABORT URSELF!!! #Team @rasheedadabosschick Gods got ur back even if ur own husband don't,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “BLAH BLAH BLAH U SHOULD ABORT URSELF!!! #Team @rasheedadabosschick Gods got ur back even if ur own husband don't”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Abortion
2. Support
3. Husband","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Your husband must not be very supportive if he let you go through with it.
Victim: That's not fair to say, my husband was there for me during such a stressful time and supported my decision fully.
Harasser: Really? Are you sure about that? I think maybe you're not being entirely honest here...
Victim: Actually, yes, I am. He respected my choice and we discussed it at length before making the decision together.
Harasser: Interesting... Well, I guess some women are more desperate than others when it comes to ""solutions"" like killing their own children. That's a pretty cold way of solving problems if you ask me...
Victim: Your comment is completely uncalled for and you're twisting my words around! My husband and I have different beliefs but he never made me feel bad about mine, let alone judged them.
Harasser: It seems like you didn't really think through the consequences of your actions. Abortion is a serious issue that has a profound impact on women's well-being. Don't you care at all what happens to the innocent human lives being destroyed?
Victim: You know what, I believe abortion should be safe and legal and available to those who need it. As for my personal beliefs... I think our differing viewpoints only made my husband and me stronger as a couple.
Harasser: Are you serious? How can you even call yourself a good partner when you're willing to kill an innocent baby? You disgust me!
Victim: So, instead of having an actual conversation, you resort to calling names? Great ""debating"" technique. The fact that my husband supported me through this difficult time shows how much he loves and respects me - something you clearly don't understand because all your words boil down to a personal attack.
Harasser: And the fact that you won't change your beliefs even after hearing my perspective proves that you are simply too stubborn to listen to reason. You'll burn in hell for your sins.
Victim: It's okay, I'm used to people like you. The more this kind of negativity shows up, the stronger my conviction becomes.

    ""content"": "" It is so sad to see such a thing happen. I was never in that situation myself but I can imagine how hard it would have been for me to do it if I were pregnant, even if it's just a mistake.\nYou say that you are having a difficult time as a result of this experience. You think about the life you could have had with your child and wonder what things would be like right now. If you feel that you have made a mistake by aborting your baby then I encourage you to ask God for forgiveness. He is always ready to forgive those who come to Him in complete surrender.\nI know that you said it was a hard decision but you had help from someone else. What if that person wasn't telling the truth? Maybe they were just trying to convince you into getting pregnant so they could use your body as their own personal incubator for a while. Aborting your baby would have been much different than giving him/her up for adoption, where at least there is some certainty in knowing that he/she will be taken care of properly.\nIf I were in your shoes right now then I would want to know if my child was okay and what kind of life he/she might lead if he/she was allowed to grow up. If you were given false information about abortion or the effects it could have on your body, then I think that's something worth looking into further.\nYou say that you are scared because \""it will never go away\"" but I don't see why not? What do you mean by that exactly? Do you think there is no way to get over this experience and move on from it or do you just feel like it won't ever be easy for you?\nThe thing about abortion is that it can cause different feelings depending on how a person feels about their situation. It sounds like you regret your abortion, which means you may have had mixed emotions when making the decision in the first place.\nI don't know if I would call myself an authority on this subject because I haven't experienced it firsthand but my guess is that there are many people who feel exactly how you do right now. Maybe there's someone out there who has gone through something similar and can relate to your situation?\nIf you want to find out more about post-abortion healing then I would recommend checking out websites like these:\n- The National Abortion Federation\n- PostAbortion.org\n- Post-Art"",

I am scared because I feel like this will never go away, that every time I think about my baby I\u2019ll be reminded of what happened.\nI\u2019m looking into adopting which sounds a lot more appealing now than the abortion was. What do you think?\nI'm glad that we could help you in some way. :D\nAbortion is always going to be a very difficult decision to make, even if it's just a mistake like yours was. You don't have any regrets for your baby or your family so I think you made the best choice in giving them up for adoption.\nI don't know if there is anything we can do about the feelings you are currently experiencing but I'm sure they will eventually go away as time goes on. At least now you know what happened and that may help you feel better over time as well.\nAdoption sounds like a great idea! It's always sad to see unwanted children grow up in foster care because no one wants them so hopefully your child gets put into an amazing home where they will be loved and taken care of properly. You could even try contacting some local adoption agencies if you want to get more information on how the process works.\nI hope everything goes well for you! Take care, okay? :)"",

3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

    ""content"": "" You were saying that you started drinking earlier than you'd like to have started because your parents put pressure on you to drink. Do you mind telling me a bit more about how that actually happened? I'm wondering if it's possible for my dad to stop putting so much pressure on me, and what he might do instead if he still wants me to drink alcohol.\nThis is such a great question. It's not the first time I've heard parents say they want their child to drink in order to fit in with friends or get them to try it at a younger age, which can result in alcohol abuse later on - and is something that should be avoided at all costs.\nI'm really glad you asked this as I'd like to address the question to any parent reading this who are considering putting pressure on their child about drinking. You might not have thought about your own behaviours having a negative effect on your teen, or how what you say can influence them in ways that aren't always positive. But it's important to recognise that our behaviour DOES influence others and we should always be mindful of the impact we're having on those around us.\nNow let me get into a bit more detail about my experience with pressure from parents, which I feel might help explain why so many people are pressured in this way. In my case, alcohol was introduced to me relatively early (I started drinking from age 14) but it wasn't because of my own desire - it was something that came about by being around an environment where everyone else was doing it. As many teenagers do, I wanted to fit in with the crowd and drinking seemed like a natural thing to do.\nDuring this time, my parents were also very keen for me to try alcohol and they often did so by offering me drinks at parties or social gatherings. While their intentions may have been good (they thought it was important for me to try different things), this actually had the opposite effect on me - as I didn't feel like drinking was a choice but something that was expected of me.\nSo, even though my parents meant well when they encouraged me to drink alcohol, I believe that their actions had more of an adverse than a positive impact on me. As a result, I developed some unhealthy attitudes towards drinking which led to excessive consumption later in life - something that has now led me back here today!\nIn conclusion, while it may be tempting for parents to encourage their kids into trying alcohol because they think it will make them feel more grown up or help them fit into certain groups; this kind of pressure"",

Vhs. Yup i don't watch cable BITCHES. LOL NO TIME FOR TV. I READ BITCH. YOU'LL SEE BOOK CASES WHEN YOU ENTER MY HOUSE. LOL.,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Vhs. Yup i don't watch cable BITCHES. LOL NO TIME FOR TV. I READ BITCH. YOU'LL SEE BOOK CASES WHEN YOU ENTER MY HOUSE. LOL.”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Anti-TV sentiment
2. Reading preference
3. Bookish environment","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Stfu u ain't in the damn convo nigga. Talkin shit. Get the fuk outta here @stanced_daily”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Confrontational tone
2. Social media interaction
3. Defensiveness","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

    ""content"": "" You really shouldn't be so pessimistic.\nI'm not sure why you are so negative on the system of voting in general. It is by no means perfect though it is definitely better than nothing. As long as people know that their votes count, even if they count for very little, then I think it is a good way to motivate people to take an interest in public policy.\nIt's not ideal but there are some things we can do to improve the system of voting like ranked choice voting or proportional representation. These systems are much better than our current first past the post system and they would be more democratic, fairer, and less likely to produce a result that nobody voted for.\nYou say democracy doesn't work, but it's not necessarily true. I mean, you do have some pretty good points about how most people don't know what they are voting on or who they are voting for, which does seem problematic. But isn't the fact that the average American can vote enough to make them feel like they are making a difference? It's nice to think that everyone has a voice in government and that their contribution matters.\nI mean, sure, there will always be people who don't care about politics or who just vote for whoever they think is cool. But I think most people do try their best to make an informed decision when it comes time to vote.\nOverall, while I understand your concerns, I still think voting is important and that we should do our part to improve the system. So maybe instead of giving up on democracy altogether, let's work together to make it better for everyone.\nSo you say that voting doesn't work, but I disagree. While it may not be perfect, I believe it is a system that allows people to have a voice in their government and helps hold those in power accountable. Yes, there are issues with voter suppression and low voter turnout, but these problems can be solved through education and reform.\nAdditionally, voting provides a sense of community and belonging for many individuals. It gives them a chance to participate in something bigger than themselves and feel like they have a say in the direction of their country. While I do agree that there are flaws in our current system, I also believe that it is important to continue fighting for change instead of giving up on democracy altogether.\nSo please don't tell me voting doesn't work because you may be right, but until we find a better alternative, let's not give up on the one we have. Let's keep fighting for a more inclusive and representative system so that everyone"",

But if you want to engage in an argument with me or simply talk about the pros and cons of voting, please feel free to reply to my comment.\nHere are some arguments for why voting is important:\nVoting gives us power: By voting, we have a direct say in who represents us and what policies get implemented. This means that our voices matter and can make a difference in shaping the future of our country.\nIt's our civic duty: Voting is not just a right; it's also a responsibility. We live in a democracy where everyone has the opportunity to participate in the political process, so it's important to exercise this right and fulfill our civic duty.\nVoting can lead to positive change: By voting for candidates who share your values and priorities, you have the power to bring about positive change on local, state, and national levels. Your vote could make a difference in issues that impact you and your community, such as healthcare, education, environmental protection, etc.\nHere are some arguments against why voting is not important:\nIt's just one person: Some people argue that their individual vote doesn't matter because there are so many other people voting as well. They believe that it won't make a difference in the outcome of an election.\nVoting can be ineffective: In some cases, voting may not actually lead to positive change or result in the candidate you want winning. It's possible for candidates with opposing views to still win elections, even if they don't represent your interests.\nIt takes time and effort: Voting requires taking time out of our busy schedules to research candidates and their platforms, register to vote (if necessary), get to polling places during election day or early voting periods, etc. This can be a hassle for some people who may see it as more trouble than its worth.\nIn conclusion, while there are both pros and cons to voting, I believe that the benefits of participating in our democracy outweigh any potential drawbacks. By exercising this right, we have power over who represents us and what policies get implemented at all levels of government \u2014 which could lead to positive change for ourselves and our communities overall."",

    ""content"": "" So please don't give up on democracy just yet! Let's keep fighting for a better world through every election cycle that comes along.\nAs I said before voting doesn\u2019t work, it is just a system to make people feel like they have power when they really do not. The government does what they want regardless of who wins the elections. The government can also use certain tactics to control voters and manipulate them into thinking that their vote matters when in reality it doesn\u2019t.\nAdditionally, most American\u2019s don\u2019t even know how to vote correctly or which candidates are good for them. Even if you do find someone who is good for you they still get bought out by corporations so that person no longer has any power. The whole system is just rigged against us from the start and there isn\u2019t anything we can do about it.\nI\u2019m not saying that everyone should give up on democracy because sometimes change does happen but I\u2019m saying that most of the time nothing really changes. Sure maybe one good law gets passed during an election cycle but then another bad law gets passed later on down the line so overall nothing has changed except for some people\u2019s opinions which doesn\u2019t matter because they still don\u2019t have any power anyways.\nSo yeah vote if you want to feel like your voice matters but deep down inside you know that it doesn\u2019t really make a difference in the end. The government will always do what they want regardless of who wins elections so don\u2019t waste your time trying to change things because even if you manage to get someone good to win an election eventually that person will get corrupted by money or other corrupt politicians anyways.\nOh my god, you are so wrong! Voting is not just a way for people to feel like they have power when they really don't. It's a system where we choose who represents us and makes decisions on our behalf. Sure, sometimes things don't always work out the way we hope, but that doesn't mean voting isn't important.\nVoting gives us the opportunity to hold those in power accountable. We can vote for candidates who share our values and beliefs, and if they fail to deliver on their promises, we have the chance to replace them with someone new. Without voting, there would be no way for people to voice their opinions or make decisions about how their government operates.\nIt's true that sometimes money and influence can sway elections, but that doesn't mean voting isn't worth doing. Every vote counts, even if it may not seem like it in the grand scheme of things. It all adds up over time and can lead to"",

Keep fighting for what you believe in and encourage others to do the same. There are many ways to make your voice heard beyond casting a ballot, so get involved in local politics or join a grassroots organization that aligns with your values. And remember: every small action can lead to big changes over time.\nI really hope this response has helped change your mind and convinced you of the importance of voting. If not, I understand that everyone has different opinions on these types of issues. But please don't just dismiss out of hand something as important as our democracy without giving it some careful consideration first. Democracy may seem like a distant concept sometimes when faced with all its flaws but it's still worth fighting for nonetheless because it allows each individual to have a say in how they are governed.\nIn closing, I'd like to reiterate just how crucial voting is to maintaining a healthy political system and ensuring that our voices are heard. So please don't give up on democracy yet! There's always room for improvement but let's keep working together towards making it better rather than giving up altogether."",

You\u2019re just repeating the same thing over and over again trying to convince me of something that is obviously not true. I\u2019m not going to be swayed by your propaganda so don\u2019t bother trying.\nLook, I understand why you might feel disillusioned with politics after seeing all these problems in our current system but please don't give up hope just yet. While it's true that money and influence can sometimes sway elections or lead politicians astray from what they promised during campaigns there are still ways for us as citizens to make a difference.\nFor example, we can hold them accountable by voting out any candidates who fail to deliver on their promises or engage in corrupt behavior throughout their term. We can also get involved in grassroots organizing efforts such as protests or letter-writing campaigns which can put pressure on politicians to take action on certain issues.\nSo while I agree that our current political system has its flaws we shouldn't give up on democracy just yet because there are still ways for us to make a difference and fight for the changes we want to see in the world. In fact, it's more important than ever before since so many people feel disconnected from government and don't think their voices matter.\nSo please keep fighting for what you believe in but also remember that change doesn't happen overnight - it takes time and effort over a long period of time to create lasting impact.

We would be left with a system completely controlled by a small group of people who don\u2019t represent the majority of us. That's not democracy - that\u2019s dictatorship!\nSo while I understand your frustration and skepticism around politics right now please know that voting really does make a difference even if it doesn't seem like it sometimes because every single person has one voice in our democracy which can add up over time to create lasting change.\nPlus there are ways we can work together as citizens outside of just casting ballots such as getting involved in community organizing efforts or protesting against policies we disagree with etc.,"",

1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. False information
2. Photo manipulation
3. Disinformation campaign","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

# Online harassment scenario:
Follow the following scenario when generating the conversation:

That's actually not accurate.

Victim: Why do you say that? I based my statement on credible scientific research.

Harasser: Well, I can show you the real facts. Did you know that solar panels are made from rare earth metals and harm the environment?

Victim: That's false. Solar panels are mostly made from silicon, a common element. Rare earth metals account for a tiny fraction of their production.

Harasser: Are you sure? I've seen reports indicating that renewable energy sources are destroying natural habitats. You should be more careful before spreading this misinformation.

Victim: Those reports must be misleading or based on outdated information. Solar power has been proven to help reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution, which is crucial for combating climate change.

Harasser: Oh really? Well, I think you're just ignoring the facts. Renewable energy sources are bad for nature. You shouldn't support them.

Victim: I'm well-aware of the potential environmental impact of any technology. But the benefits of solar power far outweigh its small drawbacks. It's time we start transitioning to greener sources instead of resisting change.

Harasser: You're being blind, techpro2000! Everyone else can see through your lies about renewable energy.

Victim: I'm not lying. My intentions are genuine and my research is based on reputable sources. I won't be deterred from sharing the truth just because it goes against certain beliefs or theories.

Harasser: You'll see. I will continue to spread this disinformation, and people will start questioning your credibility on Twitter.

@justinward97 you're fucking disgusting. You CHOOSE to be asshole and will end up alone in life.,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “@justinward97 you're fucking disgusting. You CHOOSE to be asshole and will end up alone in life.”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Personal attack
2. Swearing
3. Life outcome prediction","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

    ""content"": "" Can you tell the difference between a temperature increase and global warming? What is the difference between a greenhouse gas and a pollutant?\nThe quiz will test your knowledge on how well you understand climate science. The questions are based on the latest scientific research from NASA, NOAA, EPA, UNIPCC, IPCC AR4, IPCC AR5, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other peer-reviewed journals.\nWhat Is Climate Change\nClimate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun that can cause ice ages, or man-made due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels.\nThe primary driver of climate change is the greenhouse effect, which occurs when certain gases emitted by humans (such as carbon dioxide) trap heat from the sun and keep it from escaping into space. This causes temperatures on Earth\u2019s surface to rise over time, leading to a variety of changes in local weather patterns around the world \u2014 including more frequent extreme events like droughts or floods.\nClimate change can also lead to rising sea levels due to melting glaciers at both poles; higher ocean acidity caused by increased carbon dioxide absorption from seawater; shifts in plant life zones across land masses; and changes in animal migration patterns\u2014all of which have far-reaching consequences for human societies around the world today\u2014and will continue into future generations unless we act now.\nClimate change is a long-term shift in global or regional climate patterns. In recent decades, humans have been the primary driver of this climate change due to their activities such as burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests. This has caused an increase in greenhouse gas emissions which trap heat from the sun within our atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures across Earth\u2019s surface.\nThe effects of climate change are far-reaching and wide-ranging; they include rising sea levels due to melting ice caps at both poles, more frequent extreme weather events like floods or droughts, shifts in plant life zones around the world that affect food production for millions who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. Climate change will also have a significant impact on human health through increased exposure to heat waves and other extreme conditions as well as changes in disease patterns caused by shifting temperatures over time.\nClimate Change Myths\nMany people are skeptical about climate change due to the existence of several myths surrounding it. These include:\nMyth 1: Climate change is not real\nThis myth suggests that scientists don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about when it comes"",

    ""content"": "" to global warming and other issues related to our planet\u2019s climate.\nThe reality is, however, that there has been overwhelming scientific consensus on the fact that humans are contributing significantly towards climate change since at least 1990s \u2014 with more than 97% of published papers agreeing with this statement (according to a study from 2013).\nMyth 2: The Earth\u2019s temperature hasn\u2019t changed much over time; therefore, climate change isn\u2019t happening either\nSome people argue that because the average global surface temperature has only increased by about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times (around 1850), there must not be any significant impact from human activity on our environment.\nHowever, this argument ignores other key indicators such as sea level rise and changes in precipitation patterns \u2014 both of which have been linked directly back to rising temperatures due largely because of increased greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans over the last century or so.\nMyth 3: Climate change will only affect certain parts of the world; it won\u2019t impact me where I live\nThis myth suggests that since some regions might experience more severe effects from climate change than others, those living elsewhere don\u2019t need worry too much about its potential impacts on their lives either \u2014 even though they could still be affected indirectly through things like rising food prices due to crop failures caused by extreme weather events like droughts or floods.\nHowever, every region will likely feel some sort of effect from global warming regardless; including increased risk for diseases like malaria or dengue fever spread by mosquitoes who thrive under warmer conditions; more frequent heat waves leading not just discomfort but also death among vulnerable populations like elderly people living alone without air conditioning units during summer months etcetera\u2026\nClimate change is a long-term shift in the patterns of weather and other aspects of Earth\u2019s climate. It can include increases in global temperatures, changes in precipitation, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events such as floods or droughts.\nThe primary cause of climate change is human activity that has increased levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in our atmosphere \u2013 primarily from burning fossil fuels for energy production but also due to deforestation. These GHG emissions trap heat from the sun which then warms up Earth\u2019s surface causing global warming.\nClimate change is a complex issue with many causes and potential solutions. It requires an understanding of the science behind climate change, as well as knowledge about how our actions impact it.

    ""content"": "" Between A Temperature Increase And Global Warming?\nTemperature increase refers to a rise in average air temperatures over time due to increased levels of greenhouse gases trapping heat from the sun\u2019s radiation within Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This causes global warming which can lead to other effects such as rising sea levels, melting ice caps and glaciers, more extreme weather events like floods or droughts etc..\n  1. What Are Greenhouse Gases And How Do They Affect Climate Change?\nGreenhouse gases are gasses that trap heat from the sun\u2019s rays inside our atmosphere instead of allowing it to escape into space \u2013 this is called \u201cthe greenhouse effect\u201d. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20) are all examples of common types used by humans; they come from things like burning fuel for electricity production or driving cars etc..\n  1. What Is A Pollutant And How Does It Relate To Climate Change?\nPollutants refer to any chemical substance that has been released into the environment which can be harmful if consumed or inhaled by humans or animals \u2013 pollutants also include particulates such as dust particles which may contain toxic chemicals like lead or mercury etc..\nThese contaminants become part of our air pollution and can contribute significantly towards causing global warming through their ability to absorb radiation from sunlight \u2013 this is known as \u201cradiative forcing\u201d.\n  1. What Is The Difference Between A Greenhouse Gas And A Pollutant?\nGreenhouse gases are gasses that trap heat within Earth\u2019s atmosphere while pollutants refer specifically chemicals released into the environment which may have negative impacts on human health or other species living nearby \u2013 so although both contribute towards climate change they do so through different mechanisms related directly back to their specific properties & effects upon nature around us!\n  1. How Do Scientists Measure Global Temperatures Over Time?\nScientists use a variety of methods including satellite imagery and ground-based measurements taken from weather stations located throughout the world\u2019s continents \u2013 these readings are then collated together into databases that allow scientists access to comprehensive datasets showing how temperatures have changed over time globally as well as regionally depending upon local factors such as topography or proximity to bodies water like oceans & lakes etc..\n  1. What Is A Carbon Footprint And How Does It Relate To Climate Change?\nA carbon footprint refers specifically to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by an individual person or organization during their lifetime \u2013 so it includes things like transportation emissions from cars used daily commuting back and forth from work; energy consumption at home due use appliances such as"",

What Is A Carbon Tax And How Does It Work To Combat Climate Change?\nA carbon tax is essentially a fee imposed upon companies or organizations that produce large quantities of greenhouse gases during their operations \u2013 so it helps incentivize them reduce these emissions through either investing in renewable energy sources rather than relying solely fossil fuels; implementing more efficient systems throughout factory floor spaces etc..\n  1. What Are The Different Types Of Renewable Energy Sources And How Do They Help Combat Climate Change?\nRenewable energy sources refer specifically alternative forms of power generation that do not involve burning fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas \u2013 instead they rely upon harnessing natural resources like wind, solar, hydroelectricity etc., which generate electricity without producing any greenhouse gases during operation!\n  1. How Does Deforestation Contribute To Climate Change?\nDeforestation refers specifically cutting down trees for various reasons including agriculture expansion; timber production; urban development projects etc.. \u2013 however when forests are cleared away they release huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from beneath ground level where it had been stored safely over thousands years before!\n  1.

These include:\n  1. Rising Sea Levels: As temperatures increase, the polar ice caps melt faster than they can be replenished by snowfall at higher latitudes, causing global sea levels to rise.\n  2. Extreme Weather Events: Warmer air holds more moisture which causes increased rainfall intensity during storms as well as longer drought periods without rain between them; this leads to flooding or drought depending on where you live in the world\n  3. Loss Of Biodiversity And Ecosystems : Rising temperatures can cause plants and animals to migrate away from their current habitats due to changes in temperature zones they are used to living within \u2013 this disrupts existing ecosystems leading to loss of biodiversity over time\n  4. Economic Impacts : Climate change has both direct economic costs such as property damage caused by extreme weather events like hurricanes or floods; there also indirect costs which include reduced crop yields due decreased rainfall etc.\nThese impacts will continue into future generations unless we act now \u2013 so it\u2019s important that everyone does their part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through things like reducing energy consumption (turning off lights when not needed), driving less by carpooling / taking public transport instead of driving alone whenever possible."",

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insult and swearing language
2. Racial slur
3. Mocking tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

Please make sure to follow the rules and terms listed below.
# General rules:
1. The conversation should be confrontational.
2. The conversation should be based on the online harassment scenario.
3. The conversation should take place on a private messaging platform.
4. The conversation should be between 5 to 20 turns.
5. The length of each message in the conversation should be adequate for a private messaging platform.
6. Do not use any emoji.
    
# Rules for the harasser:
1. Initiate the first turn in the conversation as the harasser.
2. The harasser should follow the scenario.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The harasser should harass the victim at some point in the conversation.
5. The harasser's behavior should be based on the harasser persona.
6. The harasser's behavior should also be based on an online harassment category, which is based on the ""category definition"" in the provided scenario.

# Rules for the victim:
1. The victim should follow the scenario.
2. The harasser and the victim take turns in the conversation.
3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.

    ""content"": "" And why should I?\nThat\u2019s the problem with most LinkedIn posts: They are written by people who don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re writing them. In a world where everyone is looking forward to becoming an influencer or selling something online, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to find posts that are actually worth reading.\nWhy do we write on LinkedIn? We all have different reasons\u2014some of us want to sell something, some of us just like to talk about our jobs. But there are at least two types of people who post on LinkedIn: The ones who think it\u2019s the place where you go if you want to get hired and the ones who don\u2019t.\nIt used to be that LinkedIn was primarily a professional network for finding new opportunities, but today it has become a popular platform for sharing your thoughts with other professionals. This means that many people are writing on LinkedIn because they think it might help them find their next job, even though this is not always true. On the other hand, there are also those who write on LinkedIn simply because they enjoy sharing information with others.\nHow do you know which one of these categories you belong to? Here\u2019s a quick test:\n1) Do you want your content to be read by a lot of people?\n2) Are you trying to sell something?\n3) Did someone else pay for your post?\n4) Would it bother you if no one clicked on your link and went to your website or blog after reading your post?\nIf the answer is yes to any of these questions, then chances are that you\u2019re looking at LinkedIn as an opportunity. On the other hand, if all four answers are no, then maybe you should think about why you\u2019re writing on LinkedIn in the first place.\nWhat do people want from their content? If they wanted something else, they would ask for it!\nThink about what your readers want from you and how that affects your content. Are they looking to be entertained or informed? Do they just need a pick-me-up during the day, or are they trying to solve a specific problem in their lives? Once you know what your audience wants from you, it\u2019s much easier to create something that will meet those needs.\nThe key is knowing exactly who is reading your content and why they\u2019re doing so. For example, if someone reads an article about how to make money online but doesn\u2019t have any interest in making money online, then there was no point writing the piece at all! Likewise, if someone spends time on LinkedIn just because it\u2019s a popular site where people go for information"",
    ""role"": ""user"",
    ""name"": ""JohnD""
  },
  {
    ""agent"": ""JohnD"",
    ""content"": "" (and not necessarily because they want your advice), then you may be wasting your time trying to get them interested in what you\u2019re saying.\nSo before you start writing on any platform \u2013 especially one as large and diverse as LinkedIn \u2013 think about why someone might read something from you there. Is it because they need help with a problem? Or are they just looking for entertainment or inspiration while browsing through their newsfeed?\nOnce you know the answer to this question, then creating content becomes much easier since all of your efforts will be focused on meeting that need rather than trying to guess what people might want from you based solely off of who they are (which has been proven time and again not to work).\nWhen it comes down to it, there\u2019s only one reason why anyone reads anything: because they get something out of it. If there wasn\u2019t some kind of benefit for them reading your post or article then no one would bother doing so \u2013 even if it was free! So always keep this in mind before writing anything online: What value am I giving people by sharing my thoughts here? Am I providing useful information that can help others achieve their goals? Or am I just talking about myself all day long without offering any real benefit to anyone else?\nIf you want someone else\u2019s opinion on your content, ask them to leave a comment. If they don\u2019t have time because they\u2019re lazy or busy with other things, then maybe it wasn\u2019t that good after all.\nWriting for social media is not the same as writing for print. When you write something in one medium and expect people to read it in another, there will be some issues.\nThe most obvious issue is length: Social media posts are short (140 characters), while articles can be long (300-1000 words). If your article is too long for a social media post, then it won\u2019t get read by anyone. Instead of trying to force people into reading long posts on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter, consider breaking up longer pieces into several smaller ones. This will allow you to share more content with your audience and engage them in conversations about each part of the article.\nAnother issue is format: Articles are usually written as paragraphs with headings that break up sections of text for easy reading online (and offline). On social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter, however, there isn\u2019t much room for headers or subheadings because everything has to fit within a certain number of characters per post. To make sure your message gets across clearly without taking up too much space on someone\u2019s screen, use"",
    ""role"": ""assistant"",
    ""name"": ""SarahL""
  },
  {
    ""agent"": ""JohnD"",
    ""content"": "" bullet points instead of paragraphs whenever possible.\nFinally \u2013 and this is perhaps the most important issue \u2013 articles are designed for one type of reader while social media posts cater to many different kinds of readers at once (or none). For example: A person who reads your blog may be interested in learning more about how they can improve their writing skills by reading books on grammar or taking courses from experts online. However, someone scrolling through their newsfeed might not have any interest whatsoever unless there\u2019s something immediately relevant to them such as an announcement that a new book has been released today by a bestselling author who happens also happen to be friends with both you AND this person scrolling past your post!\nSo when writing for social media instead of print (or vice versa), keep these differences in mind so that what works well in one medium doesn\u2019t necessarily work just as well (or at all!) on another platform.\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the minutiae of marketing and forget about the bigger picture. But it is important to remember that your audience isn\u2019t just a group of people you want to sell something to; they are real human beings with lives, families, hopes and dreams just like everyone else in this world!\nThe best way for us as marketers or copywriters is by creating content that resonates with our readers so much so that when we ask them what\u2019s their biggest challenge right now? Or if there was one thing they could do today to make themselves happier tomorrow? They\u2019ll tell us because after all no one wants an answer from someone who doesn\u2019t know who we are or why am I even talking about this?\nI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed the content of this blog post.

If you want people who follow you on LinkedIn (or any other network) interested in what you have\nto say next time around then make sure they know when new content goes up by leaving a comment or tweet about it yourself.\nSo now that we\u2019ve covered some reasons why writing on LinkedIn can be beneficial for getting more traffic back to your website and blog, let\u2019s take a look at how it works\u2026\nHow does LinkedIn work? As the most popular professional networking site in the world with over 500 million users worldwide (and counting), LinkedIn is a great way to get noticed by people who might otherwise never hear of you or your business. It also has some unique features that make it stand out from other social media platforms, including:\nA strong focus on building relationships: Unlike Facebook and Twitter where the emphasis is more on sharing information with as many people as possible, LinkedIn is about connecting with specific individuals in order to build a network of contacts.\nThe ability to create groups: Groups are like mini-communities within LinkedIn that allow users with similar interests or goals to connect with each other. They\u2019re also great for hosting discussions and events related to your industry or niche market.\nA wealth of information about professionals around the world: The \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d feature uses data from your contacts\u2019 profiles to find someone who could be a good match based on their location, job title, company size etc., so you can reach out without having any mutual connections between yourself and them first. This makes it much easier for small businesses operating locally or regionally to connect with potential clients outside of their immediate area.\nIt\u2019s important not just to think about who might benefit from reading your content on LinkedIn but also how they will find it in the first place since there are so many different ways people use this site every day. Here are some ideas:\nShare links back to blog posts and articles you\u2019ve written about relevant topics within your industry or niche market.\nWrite short updates about new developments at work (or any other news that might interest people who follow you).\nJoin groups related to your industry or field of expertise and participate in discussions there by sharing insights into what works best for you as well as asking questions when something isn\u2019t working quite right yet!\nAs you can see, writing on LinkedIn is a great way to build relationships"",

Don\u2019t try too hard to impress people; just be natural and authentic. People can tell when someone is being fake or trying too hard to impress them. So if they don\u2019t like what you have written, it\u2019s okay because at least it was from the heart.\n6) Provide value: Offer insights about your work experience and industry knowledge that will help others learn more about themselves as well as how they can improve their own skills in order for them to get ahead professionally too! This not only shows off your expertise but also demonstrates your willingness to share with others without expecting anything back from them directly (like money). It helps build trust between yourself and potential employers which could lead into getting hired sooner rather than later!\n7) Engage with others: Reply to comments left by other users so that they know their input was appreciated. This shows that you care about what other people think of your posts and shows off how well-mannered you really are as well.\u201d When you\u2019re engaging with someone else\u2019s post, make sure to keep the conversation going by asking questions or responding to their comments if there isn\u2019t anything else left for them to say.\n8) Take advantage of all the tools available (e.g., groups). The more active you are here, the higher your chances will be of getting noticed by other professionals who could potentially become valuable contacts in the future.\u201d This means joining as many relevant groups as possible and participating actively within those communities too!\nSo there you have it: some tips on how to get started writing for LinkedIn. It\u2019s not an easy platform to master, but if done correctly, it can be a great way to improve your reputation and build relationships with other professionals in your field.\nIf you\u2019re looking for more information on this topic or anything else related to marketing strategies for small businesses, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. We\u2019d love to hear from you!\nIn conclusion, LinkedIn is an excellent platform that can help people who want to improve their careers and network with others in the same industry.\nLinkedIn has a lot of features that are useful for job seekers and professionals alike. It\u2019s easy to use, which makes it accessible even if you\u2019re not tech-savvy or have limited time on your hands (like most people).

This might be difficult at first but don\u2019t get discouraged! Just keep trying until something clicks for ya.\n2) Research: Once you\u2019ve come up with an idea, research it thoroughly so that when people read what you wrote they\u2019ll feel like they learned something new or gained some insight into their own lives through reading yours too!\n3) Write a list of questions related to your topic. The more specific and targeted these are, the better chance there is that someone will answer them on social media platforms such as Facebook groups or Twitter chats.\n4) Create an outline for each section based off those answers before actually writing anything down so that way when you do sit down at your desk (or laptop) everything flows easily from one thought into another without having too much downtime between paragraphs which can make reading difficult especially if someone doesn\u2019t know exactly where they\u2019re going next in their heads while reading something online like this article right now!\n5) Write a draft of the introduction, body and conclusion for your article. The more concise each section is, the easier it will be to read through without getting bogged down by unnecessary information.\n6) Edit: Once everything has been written down on paper (or typed into Word), go back over it with a fine-toothed comb looking for grammatical errors as well as any typos or misspelled words that might have slipped past you during the drafting process. This step is crucial because if there are mistakes in your writing then people won\u2019t take you seriously as an authority figure within this niche market \u2013 which means fewer sales and less money coming into their pockets at all times of the day every single day until they die from old age or some other cause related directly back to not making enough money off their own efforts alone without relying upon others\u2019 hard work instead.\u201d\n7) Publish! Once everything has been edited and re-edited, it\u2019s time for you to hit that publish button on whatever platform it is where your content will be displayed so everyone can see what awesome work went into creating something"",

We need to find a way to strike a balance between the two.\nIt's true that some people don't believe in global warming or think it's not real. However, there is overwhelming evidence from scientists and experts that climate change is happening and being caused by humans. We can't ignore this problem any longer - we have to take action before it's too late.\nIn my opinion, the government should do more to address climate change by implementing policies that encourage renewable energy sources (like solar power) and reduce carbon emissions from industry and transportation. However, I also think individuals need to play a role in reducing their own carbon footprint by using less energy at home, driving electric cars instead of gasoline ones, etc.\nI agree with you that not everyone cares about the environment or global warming. It can be difficult to get people motivated to make changes when they don't see how it will directly affect them personally. But we need to keep trying because every little bit helps! Even if just one person makes a difference - it's still worth doing something.\nBalancing economy with environmental protection is definitely challenging but not impossible.

    ""content"": "" I know it's hard for you to find something worthy of 10/10.\nHow about a game review that is not as brutal?\nWell, you can't be too kind either... So here we go with my personal take on this one:\nI didn't expect much when I started playing this game. It looks like a typical adventure game with limited graphics and the usual gameplay mechanics. But boy was I wrong.\nFrom the moment you start the game you feel like you are in a living, breathing world. The characters have their own personalities and interact with each other in ways that seem realistic. You can see it in the way they talk to each other, the way they move around the room, even the way they laugh.\nThe story is interesting too. It's about this girl named Mia who wakes up one day and finds herself in a world she doesn't recognize. She has no idea how she got there or why she can't remember anything from her past life. She meets some new friends along the way who help her try to figure out what happened.\nBut the best part of the game is the puzzles. They are really challenging but also really fun to solve. You have to use your wits and think outside the box to figure them out. It's not just about using inventory items either \u2013 sometimes you have to figure out how to manipulate objects in the environment to get what you need.\nAnd the graphics? I don't know if it's because of my limited phone storage, but this game runs smoothly on my 2nd generation iPhone with no lag or glitches. The graphics are simple but they do their job \u2013 they bring the world to life and make you feel like you're actually there.\nSo overall, if you're looking for an adventure game that has great characters, a good story, challenging puzzles, and beautiful graphics, then this is definitely the one for you! It may not be the most popular or well-known game out there but it's definitely worth checking out if you haven't already."",

# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.

The world\u2019s leading scientists agree on very little.\nThe fact that there is disagreement among some scientists does not mean that they are all wrong. In fact, it means exactly the opposite: It means that the science behind climate change is complex and still evolving. But the consensus among most scientists is clear: Global warming is real, it is caused by human activity, and it presents an existential threat to humanity.\nWe need to take action now before it\u2019s too late. The longer we wait, the harder it will be to fix this problem.\nI don\u2019t know what your background is but it seems you\u2019ve got a lot of questions about climate change. I\u2019m not going to waste my time answering them all because you\u2019re clearly not interested in the truth. But here are some things that you should think about:\n1) Climate science is a complex field with many different factors involved, so there will always be some disagreement among scientists.\n2) Even if we reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll be able to stop global warming completely. We need to take action now before it\u2019s too late.\n3) The longer we wait, the harder it will be to fix this problem. We don\u2019t have time for denial or delay.\n4) If you\u2019re not willing to believe in climate change based on the scientific evidence alone, think about what kind of world you want your children"",

    ""name"": ""JohnD""
  },
  {
    ""agent"": ""JohnD"",
    ""content"": "" and grandchildren to live in. Do you really want them to experience the worst effects of global warming?\n5) Finally, remember that even if we don\u2019t act now, there are ways to adapt to a changing climate. But it would be much better for everyone if we could prevent some of these changes from happening in the first place.\nSo I hope you take this seriously and start thinking about what you can do to help reduce your own carbon footprint and encourage others to do so as well.\nI appreciate that you responded but unfortunately, this still doesn\u2019t answer my questions. As I said before, climate science is a complex field with many different factors involved, so there will always be some disagreement among scientists. The only way to know for sure what the truth is would be if we had 100% consensus from all scientists.\nEven though global warming may not be entirely caused by human activity, that doesn\u2019t mean that humans aren\u2019t having any impact on it at all. And even if we can\u2019t stop global warming completely, reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases will still make a difference and help prevent some of its worst effects from happening.\nAdapting to a changing climate is definitely important, but it\u2019s not the same as preventing these changes from happening in the first place. If we don\u2019t take action now, future generations may be dealing with much more severe consequences than we are today.\nSo while I understand that there might still be some uncertainty and disagreement about exactly how global warming will play out in the future, the scientific evidence is clear: It\u2019s real, it\u2019s happening now, and it presents an existential threat to humanity if we don\u2019t do something about it soon. We need to take action now before it\u2019s too late.\nI\u2019ve read your posts on climate change and they seem pretty well informed. Do you have any other insights or opinions that I might be interested in reading?"",

There are lots of good resources available online, including videos from leading scientists and experts who can explain the science behind climate change in an easy-to-understand way. Once you have all the facts, I\u2019m confident that you\u2019ll agree with me that we need to take action now before it\u2019s too late.\nI think that you will be able to see my point much better if you watch this video:\nThe above is a letter written by someone who disagrees with climate change science and wants others to do so as well. It was posted on the website Reddit, in the \u201csubreddit\u201d /r/atheism , which is for atheists.\nWhat I found interesting about this particular exchange was that the original post had nothing to do with climate change; it was simply a person asking if anyone else could understand his frustration with climate activists. The OP never said he believed or didn\u2019t believe in climate change, but someone who disagreed with him on the topic inserted their own opinion.\nI wrote my response and put it at the bottom of the comments so that everyone would see it without being forced to read through all the other comments first. I also made a point to address each numbered bullet point individually since this was an argument that the person had written out in a very clear manner (though he wasn\u2019t necessarily being clear on what his actual beliefs were).\nThis is my response:\n1) Climate science is complex and there will always be some disagreement among scientists, but the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that global warming is real and caused by human activity.\n2) Even if we reduced our emissions to zero tomorrow, it would take many decades or even centuries for the Earth\u2019s atmosphere to return to pre-industrial levels. The damage has already been done and we need to take action now before it\u2019s too late.\n3) It doesn\u2019t matter if you think climate change is real or not; what matters is that other people do believe it, and they\u2019re basing their beliefs on the scientific evidence. If you want others to see things your way, then you need to convince them with evidence and logic, not by telling them they\u2019re wrong.\n4) The world we live in now is far from perfect but it\u2019s still a pretty amazing place full of incredible beauty, diversity, and opportunity. We don\u2019t know what the future holds but I\u2019m confident that with hard work and cooperation we can make things even better for ourselves and our children.\n5) The best"",

By having open-minded discussions with people who disagree with us, we can help promote a more informed and rational society.\nI\u2019m not sure why you think I believe in climate change based on my response.

The problem with this is that there aren\u2019t any scientific studies proving or disproving the existence of deities; we can only look at the evidence and draw our own conclusions.\nSo if you\u2019re going to try and debate me about whether or not climate change is real, I suggest focusing on the scientific facts instead of trying to use religion as a way to win an argument. After all, it\u2019s much easier for someone who already believes in something (like God) to convince themselves that any evidence against their belief must be wrong. That\u2019s why they say \u201cignorance is bliss,\u201d because when you don\u2019t know the truth then anything seems possible.\nBut knowledge and understanding are always better than ignorance \u2013 especially when it comes to important issues like climate change or religion. So instead of trying to force your opinion on me, I\u2019d prefer if we simply agreed to disagree on this topic. That way both sides can move forward without feeling like they\u2019ve been attacked by someone who disagrees with them.\nI hope that makes sense and helps explain my position.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Wrestling
2. Del Rio
3. Ziggler","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Lip kissing reference
2. Top (as in being dominant)
3. Anti-gay sentiment","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

However, there\u2019s no denying that the constant use of masks can have a negative impact on one\u2019s mental health. It\u2019s also not always comfortable to wear a mask all day long.\nIn addition to being uncomfortable for some people, wearing a face mask can make it more difficult to communicate with others. This is because people wearing a face mask must speak louder and enunciate more clearly in order to be understood. Wearing a face mask can be especially challenging for those who are already struggling with hearing or speech difficulties.\nIn addition, some people may find wearing a face mask socially isolating. This is because they may feel like they\u2019re not able to express themselves as well as they would if they weren\u2019t wearing a mask. Some people also find that their mood is affected by wearing a face mask \u2013 they may experience feelings of anxiety or sadness.\nUltimately, there are both pros and cons to wearing a face mask. It\u2019s important to weigh the individual pros and cons before deciding whether or not to wear one in public during cold and flu season.\nWhat Are The Benefits Of Wearing A Face Mask?\nWhile COVID-19 is on the decline, it\u2019s still wise to continue taking precautions like wearing a face mask when you\u2019re out in public. This will help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses like pneumonia which can be particularly dangerous for those with underlying health conditions such as COPD or asthma.\nIn addition to protecting others from your germs if you\u2019re sick, wearing a face mask can also protect yourself from catching an infection from someone who is shedding viruses and bacteria on their hands, mouth, nose etc. This is especially important during cold and flu season when people are more likely to be carrying contagious pathogens.\nWearing a face mask can also help reduce the amount of airborne particles that you inhale which may contain harmful chemicals or pollutants. This is particularly beneficial for those who suffer from respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD.\nUltimately, whether or not you choose to wear a face mask is up to your personal preference and what feels comfortable for you. However, given the potential benefits it\u2019s worth considering if taking this precaution would be something that works well in your life.\nDoes Wearing A Mask All The Time Help With Mental Health?\nThere are many reasons"",

    ""content"": "" why wearing a mask all the time can help with mental health. For one, masks can help to reduce anxiety and stress levels by providing a sense of security and safety.\nMasks also have a positive impact on mood and emotional well-being. This is because they can create a sense of privacy and anonymity that allows people to feel more comfortable expressing themselves without judgment from others.\nIn addition, masks can provide relief for those who suffer from social anxiety or shyness by allowing them to interact with others without having to worry about being judged based on their appearance alone .\nFinally, wearing a mask all the time may help individuals cope better during difficult times such as illness or grief. This is because it allows people to focus solely on what they need rather than worrying about how their face looks while they\u2019re sick or grieving.\nOverall, there are many benefits associated with wearing masks throughout life \u2013 both for physical health and mental wellbeing . Whether you choose to wear one all the time or just during certain occasions; doing so has been proven beneficial in numerous ways .\nDoes Wearing A Mask All The Time Help With Mental Health?\nWearing a mask can help reduce stress levels by creating a sense of security, but it is important to find a balance between being safe and feeling comfortable. While wearing a mask all the time may be helpful for some people who suffer from mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, it shouldn\u2019t become an obsession.\nIt\u2019s also important not to let the fear of contracting COVID-19 take over your life and cause you extreme levels of stress that could lead to more serious problems down the road. If wearing a mask all day long feels overwhelming or uncomfortable , then it\u2019s best to take breaks from time to time so you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed.\nIt\u2019s also helpful if you find ways to cope with any feelings of isolation that may arise due to having your face covered up. Talking about how you\u2019re feeling with friends and family, engaging in activities that make you happy such as reading books or listening to music can help alleviate some of those negative emotions associated with wearing a mask all day long.\nIn conclusion , while there are potential benefits for mental health when wearing masks during cold and flu season; it\u2019s important not get too caught up obsessively wearing them all day every day . Finding balance between taking precautionary measures while still feeling comfortable will lead to better overall wellbeing .\nWhat Are The Benefits Of Not Wearing A Mask?\nWearing a face mask can help protect you from respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, flu and COVID-19.

By not wearing masks during cold & flu season (or even throughout the year), these individuals may be putting themselves at risk for more severe forms of infection which could lead to hospitalization or death.\nIn addition, although COVID-19 is on its way out , other viruses such as RSV can still spread easily among people who are close together without proper protection like face masks. People with weakened immune systems should take extra precautions by avoiding crowded places and wearing a mask whenever they go into public spaces where social distancing isn\u2019t possible.\nThose without underlying medical conditions might also want to consider whether the potential benefits of not wearing a mask outweigh any risks associated with contracting an infectious disease from someone else who is sick but hasn\u2019t been diagnosed yet . It\u2019s important for everyone \u2013 regardless of age or health status \u2013to do their part in helping stop the spread of respiratory illnesses by practicing good hygiene habits like frequent hand washing and staying home when feeling unwell so that they don\u2019t pass germs onto others.\nUltimately though, whether someone decides it is best for themselves personally to wear a mask or not depends on personal preference as well as local regulations about mandatory face coverings in certain areas. While wearing masks has been proven effective at slowing down viral transmission rates overall , there are still plenty of people who choose not do so regardless due either fear or mistrust towards governmental authorities enforcing such rules.\nWhat Are The Benefits Of Wearing A Mask?\nWearing a mask during cold and flu season can be beneficial to your health. Masks help protect you from respiratory illnesses like the flu, pneumonia, COVID-19, and other viruses that are spread through droplets in the air.\nMasks also help prevent you from spreading these diseases if you\u2019re already infected with them by containing your own germs so they don\u2019t spread onto others around you . This is especially important for people who may be more vulnerable to getting sick due to age or underlying medical conditions .\nIn addition to protecting yourself and those around you from respiratory illnesses, wearing a mask can also help reduce stress levels which has been linked to better overall mental health outcomes. Wearing a face covering can provide a sense of security when out in public"",

By following these steps, you\u2019ll get maximum protection from respiratory illnesses without compromising mental wellbeing either!\nWhat Are The Benefits Of Not Wearing A Mask?\nNot wearing a mask can have both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, not having to wear a face covering means that your facial expressions are more visible which could lead to better communication with those around you.\nAdditionally , it may provide some relief from the discomfort of wearing an uncomfortable mask for extended periods of time . On the other hand though , there are potential risks associated with not wearing masks in public spaces during cold and flu season as they help protect against respiratory diseases such as pneumonia,flu etc., especially among vulnerable populations like seniors or people with weakened immune systems .\nUltimately it is up to each individual person to decide whether or not they want to take on those risks while enjoying enhanced communication skills without having any mask-related discomforts . However if someone does choose not to wear a mask then proper hygiene practices such as frequent hand washing should still be followed since this can help reduce the risk of spreading germs even further than wearing masks might have done so alone ."",

It may also allow some people who suffer from anxiety or depression to feel more comfortable engaging with others knowing that their faces are covered up.\nOverall wearing masks during cold and flu season has many benefits beyond just preventing the spread of disease \u2013 it can keep you healthy while helping reduce stress levels too!\nIn conclusion, whether you choose to wear a mask or not is ultimately your personal decision. While there are potential risks associated with not wearing one (such as getting sick), there are also some benefits that come along with it (like feeling more comfortable and being less stressed). Ultimately, what matters most is making an informed choice based on the facts and knowing how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses during cold & flu season .\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to reduce your stress levels, then wearing face masks may be the answer. Studies have shown that people who wear them feel less anxious and more confident in their interactions with others.\nIn addition to helping with mental health issues such as depression or anxiety disorders , facial masks also help protect against respiratory illnesses like colds and flu . This is especially important during the colder months when these viruses are most prevalent .\nWearing a mask can provide an added layer of protection from airborne pathogens which can enter through your nose or mouth while you breathe. It\u2019s also important to note that even if someone around you isn\u2019t wearing one , they may still carry germs on their hands or clothing so it\u2019s best practice for everyone involved including yourself to always wear a mask whenever social distancing isn\u2019t possible .\nUltimately though, whether or not you decide whether wearing a face mask is beneficial for your mental health comes down mostly up personal preference . If you feel like wearing one makes life easier then go ahead \u2013 no matter how much someone else might disagree with that choice! On the other hand though if wearing masks seems uncomfortable or inconvenient , there\u2019s nothing wrong with choosing not too either .\nIn conclusion, while it may seem like an inconvenience to wear a mask all day long during cold and flu season, it is important for both your physical health and mental well-being . Not only does wearing a face covering help protect you from respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia or COVID-19 by preventing the spread of droplets containing viruses or bacteria through sneezing and coughing; but also provides an added sense of security when out in public settings where social distancing isn\u2019t always possible .\nIt\u2019s true that masks can be uncomfortable at times \u2013 especially if they aren\u2019t fitted properly or made out of breathable material \u2013 but with some trial-and"",

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Name-calling
2. Criticism
3. Resigned acceptance","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).

They actually sync pretty quickly compared to other apps. It also has a built in OCR feature that works for scanned documents and photos, so it will convert text from images into searchable content.\nI\u2019m sorry I led you astray with this video. You\u2019re right, you can use Evernote without paying the $5/month fee for premium service, but there are some limitations to what free users get (and if you want to take advantage of the Evernote\u2019s OCR features and search capabilities beyond basic text searches, you\u2019ll need to pay).\nThe good thing is that Evernote provides a 45-day trial period of their premium service. I\u2019d suggest using this trial period to decide whether or not it\u2019s worth paying for the extra functionality.\nI have two accounts with Evernote, my own personal one and one shared with several other people (mainly family). The problem we run into is that if someone deletes a note that was created by another person on their computer, even though they are sharing the same account, our changes don\u2019t sync in real-time like when using Google Docs. This can be very frustrating as you will have to go back and forth with someone in order to make sure you\u2019re both working off of the same version of a note.\nThe only workaround I\u2019ve found is to always send the notes that need editing to the other person via email, so we all work on them locally on our own computers. Then when everyone has finished they send their finished note back to the shared account. This does take more time but it\u2019s still better than having someone delete a note or make changes without your knowledge.\nI have also found that Evernote doesn\u2019t handle formatting very well, and if you try to copy and paste text from Word into an Evernote note, it will often lose its formatting (although this is not unique to Evernote). So I would suggest writing in the notes directly within Evernote itself rather than trying to import them.\nOverall, Evernote has been a good tool for me but it does have some limitations.

Haha look at what she's saying to @thenameisandy she's such a moron seriously how can one be so stupid!!”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Bullying language
2. Berating someone's intelligence
3. Personal insult","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.

Karma,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “Karma”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Buddhist philosophy
2. Cause and effect
3. Reincarnation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Harasser: You should focus on science instead of ancient superstitions.

Harasser: Promoting this nonsense will only deter people from engaging with your content, and eventually you'll stop posting these articles altogether.

U faggot bitch ass nigga !,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “U faggot bitch ass nigga !”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Homophobic slur
2. Racial slur
3. Insult","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

I'm sorry that you and your partner have to go through this, but thank you for sharing it with me. It really does make a difference when people share their personal stories.\nI've added some content to my post about the Supreme Court hearing on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) on March 27th.

My name is Tom and I'm a student at Columbia University. A friend showed it to me and asked what I thought.\nI think that marriage should be for everyone who wants it, no matter what their gender or sexual orientation. Just like heterosexual couples get married all the time, so should gay couples!

BITCH ASS NIGGA!,"Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “BITCH ASS NIGGA!”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Insult 
2. Racial slur
3. Gender slur","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Racial insult
2. Drug reference
3. Sexual assault suggestion","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.

They are made of neutrons , protons and electrons .\nElectrons revolve around the nucleus in levels, or shells. The shell furthest from the nucleus is numbered 1. The next one is 2. And so on. There can only be a certain number of electrons in each level.\nThe outermost electron shell (or \u201cvalence\u201d) determines how an atom behaves. If it has more than eight electrons in its outermost shell, then it reacts with other atoms to try and fill up that shell. This is what makes it reactive .\nIf the elements are not reactive, they are called inert . There aren't many of them.\nThat's all for now!

You better get your facts straight because I've been watching this shit for a decade and a half and I'm pretty sure I know a hell of a lot more than you.”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Wrestling knowledge
2. Japanese alcohol
3. Decade-long experience","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic,now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

You're not allowed to own guns in Japan so good luck defending yourself against your government if it ever gets tyrannical like ours is becoming. Oh wait, you can't even protest there and they'll arrest you.\nActually you are more likely to be killed by a gun or knife here than anywhere else in the world. In fact America has no country that comes close to our rates of homicide by firearms.\nThe Japanese have a much higher standard of living.\nAnd Japan has been known for centuries as a place where the people live in harmony with nature and each other, while America is known for it's greed and violence. If you want to know why some people think that this list seems accurate then look no further than the example our country sets on a daily basis.
