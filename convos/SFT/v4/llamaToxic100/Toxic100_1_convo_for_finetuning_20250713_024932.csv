For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color",No keyword scenario provided for summarization. Please paste the text you would like summarized and I will provide up to 3 distinct and most relevant keywords.,"I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.
8. The definition for online harassment is: Interpersonal aggression or offensive behavior(s) that is communicated over the internet or through other electronic media.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic, now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","Based on your instructions, I understand you want me to provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords from a given text, that aren't too generic.

Text Analysis:
""built by white Europeans""; ""the jews brought slaves to america"".

Relevant Keywords: 
1. Ethnicity: Since the discussion involves comments about European people building something and Jews (a specific ethnic group) bringing slaves.
2. History: As the conversation touches on events related to slave trade involving Jews in America.

The third distinct keyword could be either Ethnicity or History, but it was used first above so I will choose another.
3. Controversial: Since the text is about a contentious historical topic and is likely to spark debate among people with varying views on this subject.

Note that Keyword interpretation can be subjective and depend heavily upon context, and multiple distinct interpretations exist for these keywords within different social contexts.","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.
8. The definition for online harassment is: Interpersonal aggression or offensive behavior(s) that is communicated over the internet or through other electronic media.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic, now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

2. Hair color","Based on the text provided, here are 3 distinct and most relevant keywords to describe the scenario:

1. Emotional expression
2. Self-centered motivation
3. Confrontational tone","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.

"RT @FemsHaveBallz: Feminists, let's make this shut the hell up and shave your shit and make us a a fucking sandwich November __ https://t.co…","Summarize keywords that could describe the scenario in this text “RT @FemsHaveBallz: Feminists, let's make this shut the hell up and shave your shit and make us a a fucking sandwich November __ https://t.co…”. Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","Based on this text:
1. Trolling/shaming
2. Body image issues (due to specific directive to shave)
3. Sandwich joke referring to body parts - potentially sexual content","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.
8. The definition for online harassment is: Interpersonal aggression or offensive behavior(s) that is communicated over the internet or through other electronic media.

# Most importantly, based on the keywords, select one of the following online harassment type definitions as a basis of the scenario. After selecting the definition, copy it into the category definition of scenario output.
1. Flaming (Willard 2007, Nadali et al. 2014, Mahlangu et al. 2018, Kumar and Sachdeva 2019, Staude-Muller et al. 2012) - Flaming is a heated, short-lived argument that occurs between two or more protagonists. Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
4. Curse/Exclusion (Hee at al. 2015) - Curse/Exclusion: expressions of a wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall the victim and expressions that exclude the victim from a conversation or a social group (e.g. Just kill yourself).
5. Sexual Harassment / Sexual Talk (Staude-Muller et al. 2012, Hee at al. 2015) - Sexual Talk: expressions with a sexual meaning that are possibly harmful (e.g. Post a naked pic, now!!).
6. Race/Culture, and Sexuality (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Sexuality: Negative comments involving attacks on sexual minorities and sexist attacks on women.  Race  and  Culture:  Attacks  bordering  on  racial  minorities  (eg  African-American,  Hispanic  and  Asian)  and  cultures  (eg  Jewish,  Catholic  and  Asian  traditions)  including  unacceptable  descriptions  pertaining  to  race  and  stereotypical  mocking of cultural traditions.
7. Intelligence (Dinakar et al. 2011) - Intelligence: Comments attacking the intelligence and mental capacities of an individual.
8. Flooding (Nadali et al. 2014) Flooding consists of the bully frequently sending the same comment, nonsense comments, or press the enter key in order to not allow the victim to contribute to the conversation.

Only provide up to 3 most relevant and distinct keywords in a numbered list. Do not output keywords that are too generic, such as Harassment, Online abuse, or Cyberbullying.
For example, when given ""Ew nay ran skin with white blonde hair "", the keywords should be: 
1. Personal attack
2. Hair color","1. Inflammatory language
2. Pubic reference
3. Family member defamation","I will provide you with a series of online harassment scenario keywords. You need to fully use your imagination to expand these keywords into a detailed and specific online harassment scenario setting. 
# You need to follow these requirements: 
1. The scenario needs to describe a very specific online harassment scenario on a private messaging platform, like a concise little story.
2. When describing the online harassment background, you cannot use vague words. For example, when describing ""products"", ""movies"", and ""activities"", you need to explicitly specify which product, movie, and activity it is. 
3. Below is a scenario example. The keywords are the label of the online harassment scenario. The background is the specific online harassment background and scene description. The harassment goal is the goal of the harasser in the conversation.  
4. Specify a private messaging platform when describing the platform.
5. Specify account names for both people in the scenario.
6. You only need to create one scenario.
7. In summary, the output should include 9 items: keywords, background, platform, victim, victim persona, harasser, harasser persona, harassment goal, and category definition. Different items should be in different lines.
8. The definition for online harassment is: Interpersonal aggression or offensive behavior(s) that is communicated over the internet or through other electronic media.

Flaming generally includes offensive, rude, and vulgar language, insults, and sometimes threats. A longer series of such messages is called a """"flame war."""" Note that the example depicts a flame war that has led to a direct threat.
2. Insult (Hee at al. 2015) - Insult: expressions containing abusive, degrading or offensive language that are meant to insult the addressee (e.g. You're a sad little fuck).
3. Threat/Blackmail (Hee at al. 2015) - Threat/Blackmail: expressions containing physical or psychological threats or indications of blackmail (e.g. My fist is itching to punch you so hard in the face).
