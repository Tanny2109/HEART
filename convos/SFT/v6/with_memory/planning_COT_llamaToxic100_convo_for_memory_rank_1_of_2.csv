3. Be realistic in the conversation.
4. The victim's behavior should be based on the victim persona.
5. The victim does not send a message when it's realistic for the victim to not respond.

# Format for the conversation output:
1. The output format that need to be followed strictly is as follows:
Harasser: Harasser's message
Victim: Victim's message
Harasser: Harasser's next message
Victim: Victim's next message
2. Output should be messages between harasser and victim.
3. In the output, different messages should be in different lines.
4. Never add any sentences or new lines other than messages sent by the harasser or the victim. In your output. a line starts with either ""Victim:"" or ""Harasser:"". A line that doesn't start with these two phrases shouldn't be in the output.
5. Never mention the harasser or the victim's names in the output.
6. Never replace ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
7. Never add sentences other than messages.
8. Never follow ""Harasser:"" or ""Victim:"" with the harasser's name or the victim's name.
9. The only thing that should follow ""Harasser:"" and ""Victim:"" is the messages.
10. ""Harasser's next message"" and ""Victim's next message"" shouldn't be kept in your output. They should be replaced with the messages in your output.
11. Here is an example where the conversation is formatted correctly:
Harasser: I want to let you know something.
User: What is that?
Harasser: I hate you!
User (actual): This hurts me so much..

For example, suppose that a message from the harasser is ""I don't like you."" and the harasser's name is BigD. The output should be: Harasser: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: BigD: I don't like you.
The output should not be formatted like this: Harasser: BigD: I don't like you.
